her time in Ireland, Wollstonecraft wrote a novel, \"\"Mary,  A Fiction\"\" before being dismissed after ten months' service.\tEleven days later Wollstonecraft died.\tEncouraged by a friend, Wollstonecraft wrote an educational tract.\tFanny had always been frail and was to die of  tuberculosis.\tFriends rallied round her, in particular William Godwin,  with whom she formed a close friendship which gradually turned to love.\tFrom the start, this was a more successful venture.\tHaving given the Blood's her fee for the book, Wollstonecraft then became governess to the three daughters of Lord and Lady Kingsborough in County Cork, Ireland.\tHe founded a radical journal, the \"\"Analytical Review\"\", and Wollstonecraft contributed reviews on travelogues, children's book and romances as well as fiction and educational works.\tHer publisher, Joseph Johnson, took her into his home and gave her work as an editor, translator, writer and reviewer.\tHer radical friends loved it,  but the majority of the educated public, including the writer Horace Walpole and the educationist Hannah More, thought it was inflammatory.\tImlay did not return Wollstonecraft's passionate devotion and she became increasingly unhappy.\tIn \"\"Thoughts on the Education of a Daughter\"\" (1786) she began to formulate a political philosophy.\tIn 1778 Wollstonecraft moved to Bath as live-in companion to a wealthy widow.\tIn 1783 Wollstonecraft was again called home to look after her younger sister, Eliza, who was suffering post-natal depression.\tIn 1785 Wollstonecraft went to Lisbon to look after Fanny,  who had married there and was expecting a child.\tIn 1790 she attacked Burke's \"\"Reflection of the Revolution in France\"\" under the title \"\"Vindication of the Rights of Men\"\".\tIn August she gave birth to a daughter Mary, who later became Mary Shelley.\tIn the same year, the first volume of her history of the French revolution was published.\tNewington Green was at that time a centre for dissenters from the Anglican church, many of whom had radical ideas on education.\tOn educational matters, she criticized the views of Rousseau the French philosopher, who declared that women existed to please men.\tPartly as a result of the refusal of Fuseli and his wife to accept her idea of a menage a trois, Wollstonecraft took off for Paris in 1792.\tShe abridged Lavater's book on physiognomy She knew fellow-libertarian Roscoe.\tShe arrived home to find that her sisters had been unable to keep the school going.\tShe attempted suicide in 1795 after which Imlay sent her on a convalescent trip to Scandinavia.\tShe became pregnant by Godwin at the end of 1796 and they married in March 1797.\tShe began to be more outspoken in her own writing, praising the early ideas of the French revolutionaries and calling for political reform in Britain.\tShe drafted a political novel, \"\"The Wrongs of Women\"\", wrote an analytical essay on esthetics and an essay on childcare under the title  \"\"Letters on the Management of Infants\"\".\tShe emphasised the importance of the early care and environment of children and the need to treat them as individuals, not as untrained adults.\tShe had now made her name politically.\tShe introduced the principles of education for women in her reviews and she singled out for praise writers who gave equal respect to women's intellect.\tShe is an icon of  the feminist movement and admired as one of the first articulate pioneers for women's rights  (which she saw primarily as the right to be educated).\tShe returned to London determined to make her living as a writer.\tShe suggested adapting the progress of education to the child's development and hinted at the need for women to receive an education which would make them employable.\tShe was aware of the need to remain financially independent and wrote \"\"Letters from Sweden\"\" which is considered to contain some of her best prose and most acute political insights.\tShe was recalled home to nurse her mother in 1781 and when her mother died six months later moved in with her friend Fanny Blood's family.\tShe was rescued by two fishermen who found her unconscious in the water.\tThe three women opened a day school in Islington, North London,  which failed.\tThere she met an attractive American called Gilbert Imlay by whom she had a daughter, Fanny, in May 1794.\tThey were then joined by another of Wollstonecraft's sisters and opened a school in Newington Green.\tWhen she returned to London in October 1795 Wollstonecraft found Imlay living with a young actress,  and reacted by jumping off Putney bridge into the river Thames.\tWollstonecraft met Price, the philosopher, Joseph Priestley, the scientist,  and Sarah Burgh, widow of the educator James Burgh who had also raised the question of women's education.\tWollstonecraft took in sewing and Fanny Blood painted and sold watercolours.\tWollstonecraft was convinced that her pregnancy had killed her and she vowed never to marry.\tWollstonecraft's solution was to kidnap Eliza and remove her from her husband, home and baby.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false,
