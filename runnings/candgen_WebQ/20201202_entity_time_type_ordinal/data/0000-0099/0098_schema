as Lincoln became President of the Union, Davis sent envoys with a demand for independence for the Southern states.\tAt the outbreak of the Mexican War Davis resigned and joined the First Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers as a colonel.\tBetween them, they operated an aggressive defence strategy, with a commitment to moving the army to where the fighting should be, rather than setting up a defensive perimeter round the south.\tBy now, the break-up of the Union was inevitable and Davis agreed to become President of the Confederacy.\tDavid decided to go into politics as a Democrat, determined to uphold states' rights.\tDavis graduated from West Point in 1828 as a lieutenant in the infantry, in a peacetime army in which there was little chance of promotion.\tDavis took the government south,  with a plan to continue fighting until able to negotiate secession.\tDavis was initially successful in establishing a strong lead, but failed to generate the teamwork necessary between government and army and he failed to inspire the south.\tDuring the course of the Civil War, Davis formed a strong central government, but, although he was careful to act through Congress, he still took personal control when he felt it was needed.\tFinally, in Appomattox in April 1865, General Lee surrendered to Union forces without the permission of Davis or Congress.\tFor strategic reasons he put state troops under central government control, refusing to allow each state to keep its troops for its own defence.\tGreeley was a supporter Opposed Mississippi improvement bill advanced by Eads.\tHe became more popular in the south for a while when he laid the cornerstone of a Confederate monument in Montgomery, Alabama in 1886.\tHe brought shipping and railroads under government control, in a move to ensure economic viability and political independence for the Confederacy.\tHe created factories, set up salt mines and restored naval yards, and sent diplomats and agents to England and France to argue the southern case and to buy weapons.\tHe insisted that the Confederacy couldn't afford to support these people.\tHe introduced the idea of promotion on merit, expanded the army and its arsenal and strengthened coastal defences, as well as pushing for a transcontinental railroad on the grounds of national security.\tHe promoted Lee to the job of commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.\tHe resigned his commission in 1835.\tHe spent most of his time in Richmond and on the occasions when he travelled south, he failed to inspire.\tHe took part in the capture of Monterrey then, in the battle of Buena Vista, in which he was praised for his tactics, he was wounded and returned home in 1847 a state hero.\tHe was captured in Georgia a month later by Union cavalry and held in Fort Monroe in Hampton Roads, Virginia.\tHe was included in the general amnesty of 1868, but would not take the oath of loyalty to the United States, so never regained his citizenship.\tHe wrote his memoirs of the presidency, ' The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government',  published in 1881.\tHis opposition to the Missouri Compromise of 1850 (in which slavery was banned north of latitude 36o 30'), was a vote-winner in the south.\tIn 1843 he failed in his bid for election to the State Legislature, but two years later he was elected to Congress.\tIn 1853, when President  Pierce appointed him Secretary of War, Davis set about reforming the army.\tIn 1862 he introduced conscription and suspended the writ of habeas corpus.\tIn 1869, he took a job in Memphis as president of a life insurance company, resigning four years later.\tIn a short time, the size of the Confederacy's administration was greater per capita than that of the Union.\tIn his later years, he tried to get his plantation back,  and to defend his presidential reputation from attack by former Confederates.\tIndicted for treason, he welcomed the possibility of a trial,  and a number of northern lawyers, appalled by his treatment in prison, volunteered their services.\tLate in the war, Davis had the idea of freeing slaves and arming them to fight for southern independence and, eventually, the Confederate Congress agreed.\tLincoln refused to meet the envoys and, in April 1861, Davis sent troops against Fort Sumter, to drive the Union army out of what he saw as sovereign southern territory.\tNominated for the US Senate, he won the seat and went to Washington on crutches.\tOn the subject of states' rights, he argued that it was unconstitutional to ban slavery in territories which had yet to achieve statehood and receive their own constitutional powers.\tOver the next couple of years, Davis made several business trips to Europe, but was unsuccessful at getting any of his business proposals off the ground.\tReleased on bail after two years, Davis went to Canada to recover.\tThe US government avoided bringing him to trial.\tThe prison environment there was harsh and Davis was kept for a while in leg-irons.\tTheir military strength was weakened, however, because of judgement errors in some of the appointments they made,  and overall lack of commitment in the West.\tThen, in 1861, when Mississippi seceded as well, Davis, still in favour of peace, resigned from the Senate.\tThere, he became a dedicated expansionist and agitated for the annexation of large areas of Mexican territory, as well as the acquisition of Cuba.\tThis attack meant that the south was now at war with the north.\tWhen South Carolina seceded from the Union, he supported its right to do so, but continued to speak against secession.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.043q0", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
