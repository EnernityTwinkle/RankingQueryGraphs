day in the new Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam examining Rembrandt's \"\"The Jewish Bride\"\", Van Gogh decided he must master the use of color.\tAfter a year, he  yearned to see Theo and the north again discharged himself.\tAfter three months, loneliness drove him back to his father's parsonage.\tAt first this seemed to soothe Van Gogh.\tAt the beginning of 1888, he left Paris for southern France, saying he wanted \"\"to look at nature under a brighter sky\"\".\tAt the end of 1883, he went to Drenthe, a remote part of northern Netherlands.\tAware that Gauguin was preparing to leave, Van Gogh became agitated and mentally unstable.\tBack in Paris, Van Gogh stayed with Paul-Ferdinand-Gachet, a homeopathic doctor,  artist and friend of Pissarro.\tBack in the Netherlands, his uncle again came to the rescue, finding him a job with a bookseller in Dordrecht, which Van Gogh took up in early 1877, at age 24.\tBelieving Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec would share his dream, he rented a house and prepared it for a community of \"\"Impressionists of the South\"\".\tBut after Gauguin arrived, it became clear they were not like-minded.\tBut the serenity did not last and he quarreled with Gachet.\tBy 1888, he had found his post-Impressionist style and painted the masterpieces: \"\"Portrait of Pere Tanquy\"\" and \"\"Self-Portrait in Front of an Easel\"\".\tBy chance, he met Pissarro in the street and immediately brought out his own canvases, propped them up against a wall, and begged for advice.\tCormon was more open-minded than most traditional teachers and also much admired as a colorist.\tDegas and sculptor Henry Moore.\tDevastated that he would once again be a burden on Theo, lonely,  and convinced he would never be cured, Van Gogh shot himself on July, 27, 1890.\tDuring this time, he read the social novels of Dickens and Hugo, which exactly suited  his mood.\tFearing he no longer would be able to paint, and seeing art as he only way to retain his sanity,  Van Gogh committed himself to an asylum at St.-Remy-de-Provence in April, 1889.\tFor a short time, Van Gogh became an itinerant lay preacher in England, but it became obvious he was mentally unstable and unsuited to the life.\tFor example, his famous painting of \"\"The Potato Eaters\"\" shows a family eating from a common dish of potatoes.\tGachet lived in Auvers-sur-Oise, a small village.\tGoupil's sent him to Paris with another promotion, but Van Gogh now saw salon art as irrelevant,  and art dealing as useless.\tHe also discovered Japanese prints.\tHe came up with the idea of establishing a community of like-minded artists.\tHe considered Carot a great nature painter, but felt Carot had been badly used by the Salon, which had offered him the medal of honor only to withdraw it at the last moment.\tHe died two days later.\tHe enrolled at the Academy in Antwerp, where the greatest numbers of Rubens's  paintings were.\tHe had great regard for Gauguin's Martinique work and his forceful personality.\tHe later said that as he sat in the museum, he had also thought of Paul Rubens and his use of color.\tHe moved to The Hague at the end of the year,  meeting other artists and studying works in the museums.\tHe next studied drawing at the Academy in Brussels and in 1881 went home to draw the countryside.\tHe painted cornfields, the church, and the river valley in a less contorted way and with less violent use of color.\tHe painted quickly and intensely.\tHe savored the art for its \"\"liberating power of color\"\".\tHe studied theology in Amsterdam briefly, then studied with Evangelists in Brussels, but they dismissed him after three months.\tHe was taken on as a missionary in Borinage, a coal-mining area in Belgium.\tHis paintings of the period seem calmer.\tIn 1873 he was sent to Goupil's in London,  to manage the photographic reproduction section.\tIn 1875, he attended the funeral of Corot as an act of protest.\tIn 1882, he began to paint in oils and then discovered the works of Zola.\tIn 1885, he read Zola's \"\"Germinal\"\", a novel depicting the grim reality of life in a coal-mining region, and  was greatly impressed.\tIn Arles, he painted landscapes, portraits, interiors and his renowned sunflowers.\tIn charge of photograph reproductions, he one day came  across photos of paintings by  Millet and was enthralled.\tLike Zola, Van Gogh's work implied a criticism of the social order.\tMatisse bought his work.\tOn Christmas Eve, Gauguin discovered that Van Gogh had cut off part of his left ear.\tOver the next two years, Van Gogh drew and painted landscapes, figures and still-life, all related to the peasantry.\tPissarro ignored the passers-by and discussed Van Gogh's art with him, saying it was impossible to create light with white paint.\tSickert  criticised his work.\tThe Hague.\tThe greatest Dutch painter after Rembrandt and one of the greatest of the post-Impressionist painters.\tTheo enrolled him in Cormon's studio.\tThey could not even share the same house amicably.\tThrough Theo, he met the French artists who were revolutionizing art: Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, Seurat and others.\tVan Gogh persuaded his brother Theo to let him come to Paris to work at  Cormon's studio.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.07_m2",
