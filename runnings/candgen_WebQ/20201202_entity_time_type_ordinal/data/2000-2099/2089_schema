with which went the supreme command of the armed forces of the Reich - and all officers and ministers took an oath of allegiance to Hitler personally.\tBy July 1933, Hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the Communists, Social Democrats and Jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps.\tBy November 1923 Hitler was convinced that the Weimar Republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with Ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich.\tConvinced that the natural field of expansion for German Lebensraum lay eastwards, on 1 September 1939 German armies invaded Poland (the independence of which was guaranteed by Britain and France), and two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany.\tDuring the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, Hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in Germany, and helped (along with Goebbels' propaganda) Germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of German life, enforced by Himmler's Secret State Police (Gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and Jews, who were systematically persecuted.\tDuring the years 1930-33 Hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in Germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher Heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian Spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'Landbund', or League of Land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the Weimar Republic.\tDuring this Vienna period (1907-13), Hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-Semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in Austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, Lanz von Liebenfels (whose theory of \"\"Theozoology\"\" divided humanity into two groups - Aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the Austrian Pan-German leader, Georg von Schoenerer.\tFrom January 1945 Hitler never left the chancellery bunker in Berlin.\tFrom his experiences, Hitler had now learned that the road to power lay not through force alone, but through legal subversion of the Weimar Constitution, and he set out to build a mass movement empowered by a combination of parliamentary strength and extra-parliamentary street terror and intimidation.\tFrom the first, Hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly General Ludwig Beck, chief of the general staff) that Germany was not strong enough to defeat the Allied powers.\tFrom these Hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his Socialist and Communist opponents.\tFrom these and other sources, the young Hitler began to construct a vision of the world in which Jews (by race, rather than by religion) became the symbol and cause of all chaos, corruption, and destruction in culture, politics and the economy, and that the press, prostitution, syphilis, capitalism, Marxism, democracy and pacificism were all means exploited by 'the Jew' in his conspiracy to undermine the German nation and the purity of the creative Aryan race.\tHad political connection with Benes.\tHe  directed Himmler to prepare the ground for the \"\"New Order\"\" in Europe, and the concentration camps in Poland were expanded, in preparation for what had now become a policy of the liquidation of all Jews under German rule.\tHe also began preparing for the war of revenge he had promised in 'Mein Kampf.'  In 1935 he abandoned the Versailles Treaty, re-establishing universal military service, building a powerful air force, and persuading the British to sign a naval treaty recognizing Germany's right to rearm.\tHe quickly showed a marked talent for inflammatory speaking, political agitation and party organization.\tHe refused to read reports of defeats, and those close to him, especially his secretary Martin Bormann, took care that only positive information reached him.\tHe then spent four years at the Linz Realschule, followed by a period at a boarding school in Steyr.\tHe then turned his attention to the Balkans and North Africa, where his Italian allies had suffered defeats, and the German armies rapidly overran Greece, Yugoslavia, the island of Crete and Cyrenaica.\tHe was badly gassed four weeks before the end of the war and, temporarily blinded, spent three months recuperating in a hospital in Pomerania   During the war Hitler had found comradeship, discipline, and participation in conflict intensely satisfying, and in November 1918 learned with horror of Germany's defeat,  and of the humiliation of the armistice arranged  by the 'big three':  Lloyd George (UK) , Clemenceau (France) and Woodrow Wilson (US).\tHis 'Third Reich', which was to have endured forever, ended after twelve years of unparalleled brutality, in which 30 million people lost their lives, twelve million of them far from the battlefields:  by mass shootings, in forced labour camps and in the gas ovens of Belsen, Dachau, Auschwitz, Ravensbruck and other concentration camps in accordance with Nazi racial theories.\tHis anti-Jewish laws caused physicist Born to be fired.\tHis narrow escape convinced him that he had been chosen by God to lead the German people, and he drastically reduced the army's independence, appointing National Socialist political officers to all military positions.\tHitler attended a primary school in Braunau for five years, and then moved with his family to Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, on his father's retirement in 1897.\tHitler escaped with only minor injuries, however, and ordered the execution of all those implicated.\tHitler failed to succeed in his studies and left school in 1905 to become a painter.\tHitler left the army in 1920, and became party propagandist, editing the party newspaper the 'Volkischer Beobachter' ('People's Observer'), arranging frequent meetings, changing the name of the party to the National-sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (the National Socialist German Workers' Party, NSDAP or Nazi Party), imposing himself as its Chairman by July 1921, and giving the new Party its symbol - the swastika - and its greeting, 'Heil!'.\tHitler was tried on 26 February 1924 and  sentenced to five years imprisonment at Landberg fortress.\tHowever, he was released after only nine months, during which he dictated to Hess his autobiography and personal testament 'Mein Kampf' ('My Struggle'),  published in 1925 and which by 1939 had sold five million copies, making Hitler a wealthy man.\tHowever, the depression of 1929 enhanced the appeal for the Nazis, and Hitler found support among wealthy industrialists keen to finance a strong right-wing, anti-democratic government, which at last placed the Party on a secure financial footing.\tIn 1936, he occupied and fortified the Rhineland,  with the Italian dictator Mussolini began sending military aid to Franco's fascist forces in Spain, and in October 1936 forged the Rome- Berlin Axis.\tIn August 1914 he enlisted in the Sixteenth Bavarian Infantry Regiment, serving as a despatch runner on the Western front.\tIn August 1939, Hitler and Stalin signed a nonaggression pact,  freeing Hitler to turn his full attention to Western Europe.\tIn December 1944 he moved his headquarters to Berlin, where he directed the German offensive in the Ardennes.\tIn February 1938, he dismissed 16 senior generals and took personal command of the armed forces.\tIn July 1943 the Allies captured Sicily and Mussolini's regime collapsed in Italy.\tIn June 1934, Hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the SA and its leader, Captain Ernst Rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms.\tIn March 1938, he forced Austria into 'Anschluss' (political union) with Germany, making a triumphantal entry into Vienna.\tIn May 1913, Hitler left Vienna for Munich, Germany in order to avoid military training in Austria.\tIn September 1943, the Allies invaded Italy, and then Normandy, France in June 1944.\tIn the 1932 elections, just after becoming a German citizen, Hitler opposed the aging Hindenburg in the presidential election, taking  36.8 percent of the vote on the second ballot and depriving von Hindenburg of the necessary absolute majority.\tInfluenced by theories of Mackinder and Gobineau.\tOn 29 April, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, Hitler married his long-term mistress Eva Braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed Admiral Donitz as head of state and Goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"\"Above all, I charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international Jewry.\"\" The following day, Hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the Reich Chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, Trevor-Roper's^:  'The Last Days of Hitler', 1947).\tOn 29 July 1944 came the last of several attempts to assassinate Hitler when Colonel  von Stauffenberg exploded a time bomb at a conference at Hitler's field headquarters.\tOn 29 September 1938, Hitler and Mussolini met at Munich with the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, who agreed to the bloodless surrender of the Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia, and in March 1939 German troops entered Prague and the absorption of Czechoslovakia was complete.\tOn his release, Hitler began to rebuild the Nazi Party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of Goering, Hess and Goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival Nazi leader, Gregor Strasser.\tOn leaving hospital, Hitler returned to Munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist German Workers' Party (DAP), which Hitler joined in September 1919.\tOut of this grew the storm troopers (SA), organized in 1921 by Captain Ernst Rohm, and Hitler's black-shirt personal bodyguard force, the 'Schutzstaffel' (SS).\tSoon a million Allied troops were driving the German allies eastwards, while the Soviets came from the opposite direction.\tThe Battle of Britain, in which the Royal Air Force denied the Luftwaffe aerial control over the English Channel, was Hitler's first setback, and in October 1940 he cancelled the invasion code- named  Operation Sea Lion.\tThe Nazi Party adopted the ideas Hitler had acquired in Vienna - violent racial nationalism, anti-Semitism and opposition to liberal democracy, combined with perverted versions of the philosophies of such German thinkers as Haeckel and Nietzsche - combined with a hatred of the post-war republican German government and 'socialistic' ideas of profit-sharing and nationalization.\tThe attack against the U.S.S.R., racially and ideologically justified by Hitler as an anti- Bolshevik anti-Jewish crusade, was finally launched on 22 June 1941, with Hitler so confident of success that he announced it would be over in six weeks, and refused to provide winter clothing and equipment for his troops.\tThe first phase of World War II was dominated by German 'Blitzkrieg' tactics - sudden shock attacks against airfields, communications, military installations, using fast mobile armour and infantry to follow up the first wave of bomber and fighter aircraft,  through which Poland was overrun in 19 days, Denmark and Norway in two months, and Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France in six weeks.\tThe mid-1920s saw a period of economic stability in Germany, and while in January 1925 the ban on the party was removed in Bavaria, allowing Hitler to speak in public, elsewhere prohibitions remained in force until 1927-28, and the Nazi Party won only 12 seats in the 1928 elections.\tThen, in spite of a decline in the party's votes to 11 million in November 1932, Hitler was helped to power by a deal with former Chancellor Papen, in which they secretly agreed to work together for a government in which Hitler would be chancellor and Papen's conservative supporters would hold important ministeries.\tThis widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove Hitler to implement the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question' which had been under consideration since 1939.\tWhen it failed, he clutched at fantastic hopes that his 'secret weapons', the V-1 and V-2 rockets, would turn the tide of war.\tWith the failure of the British campaign, Hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.07_m9_", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
