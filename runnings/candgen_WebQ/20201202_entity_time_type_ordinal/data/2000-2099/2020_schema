I have been pouring van loads of information into that vacancy of oblivion I call my mind.\tAmerica's founding fathers did not intend to take religion out of education. Many of the nation's greatest universities were founded by evangelists and religious leaders; but many of these have lost the founders concept and become secular institutions. Because of this attitude, secular education is stumbling and floundering.\tAmerica's greatness has been the greatness of a free people who shared certain moral commitments. Freedom without moral commitment is aimless and promptly self-destructive.\tAn education isn't how much you have committed to memory, or even how much you know. It's being able to differentiate between what you do know and what you don't.\tAn education obtained with money is worse than no education at all\tAn educational system isn't worth a great deal if it teaches young people how to make a living but doesn't teach them how to make a life.\tAn effeminate education weakens both the mind and the body.\tAnyone who has passed through the regular gradations of a classical education, and is not made a fool by it, may consider himself as having had a very narrow escape.\tAnyone who knows history, particularly the history of Europe, will, I think, recognize that the domination of education or of government by any one particular religious faith is never a happy arrangement for the people.\tBandara was not an easy place to return to:  it could hide from the common worlds whose periphery it inhabited.  But Bandara never had, in all its years, completely disappeared.\tEducate people without religion and you make them but clever devils.\tEducation at school continues what has been done at home: it crystallizes the optical illusion, consolidates it with book learning, theoretically legitimizes the traditional trash and trains the children to know without understanding and to accept denominations for definitions. Astray in his conceptions, entangled in words, man loses the flair for truth, the taste for nature. What a powerful intellect must you possess, to be suspicious of this moral carbon dioxide and with your head swimming already, to hurl yourself out of it into the fresh air, with which, into the bargain, everyone round is trying to scare you!\tEducation can no longer be the sole property of the state.\tEducation comes from within; you get it by struggle and effort and thought.\tEducation forms the common mind. Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.\tEducation has become a prisoner of contemporaneity. It is the past, not the dizzy present, that is the best door to the future.\tEducation has opened many, many doors. However, there are still innumerable doors shut tight -- unopened yet. These are the doors of the future. Perhaps one of my children will open one of these doors -- I shall help give him the key.\tEducation helps one case cease being intimidated by strange situations.\tEducation in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion, and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion.\tEducation is a crutch with which the foolish attack the wise to prove that they are not idiots.\tEducation is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade of prejudices.\tEducation is a progressive discovery of our ignorance.\tEducation is a social process. Education is growth. Education is, not a preparation for life; education is life itself.\tEducation is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.\tEducation is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.\tEducation is hanging around until you've caught on.\tEducation is not received. It is achieved.\tEducation is our only political safety. Outside of this ark all is deluge.\tEducation is that which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding.\tEducation is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.\tEducation is the art of making man ethical.\tEducation is the best provision for old age.\tEducation is the knowledge of how to use the whole of oneself. Many men use but one or two faculties out of the score with which they are endowed. A man is educated who knows how to make a tool of every faculty--how to open it, how to keep it sharp, and how to apply it to all practical purposes.\tEducation is the period during which you are being instructed by somebody you do not know, about something you do not want to know.\tEducation is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the worlds work, and the power to appreciate life.\tEducation is the progressive realization of our ignorance.\tEducation is what you get from reading the fine print. Experience is what you get from not reading it.\tEducation must have two foundations --morality as a support for virtue, prudence as a defense for self against the vices of others. By letting the balance incline to the side of morality, you only make dupes or martyrs; by letting it incline to the other, you make calculating egoists.\tEducation, then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men -- the balance-wheel of the social machinery.\tEnlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.\tEvery act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one's self-esteem. That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily; and why older persons, especially if vain or important, cannot learn at all.\tEvery man who knows how to read has it in his power to magnify himself, to multiply the ways in which he exists, to make his life full, significant and interesting.\tEvery uneducated person is a caricature of himself.\tFormal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.\tHe is to be educated not because he's to make shoes, nails, and pins, but because he is a man.\tHe who opens a school door, closes a prison.\tHow could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living?\tI am afraid that the schools will prove the very gates of hell, unless they diligently labor in explaining the Holy Scriptures and engraving them in the heart of the youth.\tI am entirely certain that twenty years from now we will look back at education as it is practiced in most schools today and wonder that we could have tolerated anything so primitive.\tI can prove at any time that my education tried to make another person out of me than the one I became. It is for the harm, therefore, that my educators could have done me in accordance with their intentions that I reproach them; I demand from their hands the person I now am, and since they cannot give him to me, I make of my reproach and laughter a drumbeat sounding in the world beyond.\tI have never let my schooling interfere with my education.\tI just graduated and already I'm way behind.\tI pay the schoolmaster, but it is the school boys who educate my son.\tIf a man empties his purse into his head, no man can take it away from him. An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.\tIf an educational act is to be efficacious, it will be only that one which tends to help toward the complete unfolding of life. To be thus helpful it is necessary rigorously to avoid the arrest of spontaneous movements and the imposition of arbitrary tasks.\tIf education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated lines of a mere transmission of knowledge, there is little to be hoped from it in the bettering of man's future. For what is the use of transmitting knowledge if the individual's total development lags behind?\tIf nobody dropped out of eighth grade, who would hire the college graduates?\tIn large states public education will always be mediocre, for the same reason that in large kitchens the cooking is usually bad.\tIn true education, anything that comes to our hand is as good as a book: the prank of a page- boy, the blunder of a servant, a bit of table talk -- they are all part of the curriculum.\tIt don't make much difference what you study, so long as you don't like it.\tIt is because the body is a machine that education is possible. Education is the formation of habits, a superinducing of an artificial organization upon the natural organization of the body.\tIt is no small mischief to a boy, that many of the best years of his life should be devoted to the learning of what can never be of any real use to any human being. His mind is necessarily rendered frivolous and superficial by the long habit of attaching importance to words instead of things; to sound instead of sense.\tIt is only the ignorant who despise education.\tIt is our American habit if we find the foundations of our educational structure unsatisfactory to add another story or wing. We find it easier to add a new study or course or kind of school than to recognize existing conditions so as to meet the need. strangled the holy curious of inquiry. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.\tIt is very nearly impossible... to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind.\tIt should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.\tIt's fairly obvious that American education is a cultural flop. Americans are not a well-educated people culturally, and their vocational education often has to be learned all over again after they leave school and college. On the other hand, they have open quick minds and if their education has little sharp positive value, it has not the stultifying effects of a more rigid training.\tKnowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.\tLearned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.\tLet us describe the education of our men. What then is the education to be? Perhaps we could hardly find a better than that which the experience of the past has already discovered, which consists, I believe, in gymnastic, for the body, and music for the mind.\tLet us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.\tLife is my college. May I graduate well, and earn some honors.\tMistakes are a great educator when one is honest enough to admit them and willing to learn from them.\tModern education has devoted itself to the teaching of impudence, and then we complain that we can no longer control our mobs.\tMuch learning does not teach understanding.\tNine tenths of education is encouragement.\tNo amount of charters, direct primaries, or short ballots will make a democracy out of an illiterate people.\tNow, if the principle of toleration were once admitted into classical education --if it were admitted that the great object is to read and enjoy a language, and the stress of the teaching were placed on the few things absolutely essential to this result, if the tortoise were allowed time to creep, and the bird permitted to fly, and the fish to swim, towards the enchanted and divine sources of Helicon --all might in their own way arrive there, and rejoice in its flowers, its beauty, and its coolness.\tOn the education of the people of this country the fate of the country depends.\tOnly the educated are free.\tOur attitude towards ourselves should be to be satiable in learning and towards others to be tireless in teaching.\tOur progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. The human mind is our fundamental resource.\tOur school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud, by teaching evolution as fact.\tOut of my general world-pattern-trend studies there now comes strong evidence that nothing is going to be quite so surprising and abrupt in the future history of man as the forward evolution in the educational process.\tPeople commonly educate their children as they build their houses, according to some plan they think beautiful, without considering whether it is suited to the purposes for which they are designed.\tPerhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the things you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a person's training begins, it is probably the last lesson a person learns thoroughly.\tPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\tPublic school is a place of detention for children placed in the care of teachers who are afraid of the principal, principals who are afraid of the school board, school boards who are afraid of the parents, parents who are afraid of the children, and children who are afraid of nobody.\tPublic schools are the nurseries of all vice and immorality.\tReal education must ultimately be limited to men who insist on knowing. The rest is mere sheep-herding.\tRespect the child. Be not too much his parent. Trespass not on his solitude.\tSay not, when I have leisure I will study; you may not have leisure.\tSchool is where you go between when your parents can't take you, and industry can't take you.\tShortchange your education now and you may be short of change the rest of your life.\tShowing up at school already able to read is like showing up at the undertaker's already embalmed: people start worrying about being put out of their jobs.\tSince every effort in our educational life seems to be directed toward making of the child a being foreign to itself, it must of necessity produce individuals foreign to one another, and in everlasting antagonism with each other.\tSoap and education are not as sudden as a massacre, but they are more deadly in the long run. Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education.\tSpoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon.\tTalk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours.\tThe best education in the world is that got by struggling to get a living.\tThe child who desires education will be bettered by it; the child who dislikes it disgraced.\tThe creative person is usually rebellious. He or she is the survivor of a trauma called education.\tThe difficulty is to try and teach the multitude that something can be true and untrue at the same time.\tThe educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead.\tThe education of a man is never complete until he dies.\tThe first condition of education is being able to put someone to wholesome and meaningful work.\tThe great difficulty in education is to get experience out of ideas.\tThe highest result of education is tolerance.\tThe liberally educated person is one who is able to resist the easy and preferred answers, not because he is obstinate but because he knows others worthy of consideration.\tThe main part of intellectual education is not the acquisition of facts but learning how to make facts live.\tThe mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.\tThe most difficult thing in the world is to know how to do a thing and to watch somebody else doing it wrong, without comment.\tThe most important part of education is proper training in the nursery.\tThe most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know.\tThe most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it has to be done, whether you like it or not.\tThe only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it.\tThe paradox of education is precisely this -- that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.\tThe purpose of education is to keep a culture from being drowned in senseless repetitions, each of which claims to offer a new insight.\tThe purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one\tThe regeneration of society is the regeneration of society by individual education.\tThe roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.\tThe school system, custodian of print culture, has no place for the rugged individual. It is, indeed, the homogenizing hopper into which we toss our integral tots for processing.\tThe secret in education lies in respecting the student.\tThe system -- the American one, at least -- is a vast and noble experiment. It has been polestar and exemplar for other nations. But from kindergarten until she graduates from college the girl is treated in it exactly like her brothers. She studies the same subjects, becomes proficient at the same sports. Oh, it is a magnificent lore she learns, education for the mind beyond anything Jane Austen or Saint Theresa or even Mrs. Pankhurst ever dreamed. It is truly Utopian. But Utopia was never meant to exist on this disheveled planet.\tThe task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles, but to irrigate deserts.\tThe whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence.\tThe world is run by C students.\tThe wretch who digs the mine for bread, or ploughs, that others may be fed, feels less fatigued than that decreed to him who cannot think or read.\tThere are two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.\tThere is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide.\tThere is hardly a pioneer's hut which does not contain a few odd volumes of Shakespeare. I remember reading the feudal drama of Henry V for the first time in a log cabin.\tThere is no education like adversity.\tThere is only one thing for it then -- to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it...\tThere is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius.\tThere's a new tribunal now higher than God's --The educated man s!\tThey know enough who know how to learn.\tThey teach in academies far too many things, and far too much that is useless.\tThose who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.\tThose who trust us educate us.\tTo educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.\tTrain up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart from it. -- Proverbs 22:6\tUpon the education of the people of this country the fate of this country depends.\tUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people may be engaged in. That everyone may receive at least a moderate education appears to be an objective of vital importance.\tWe are born weak, we need strength; helpless, we need aid; foolish, we need reason. All that we lack at birth, all that we need when we come to man's estate, is the gift of education.\tWe are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a belly-full of words and do not know a thing. The things taught in schools and colleges are not an education, but the means of education.\tWe live less and less, and we learn more and more. Sensibility is surrendering to intelligence.\tWe only labor to stuff the memory, and leave the conscience and the understanding unfurnished and void.\tWhat does education often do? It makes a straight-cut ditch of a free, meandering brook.\tWhat sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to an human soul.\tWhat usually happens in the educational process is that the faculties are dulled, overloaded, stuffed and paralyzed so that by the time most people are mature they have lost their innate capabilities.\tWhat we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the substitution of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real.\tWhen a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course.\tWhom do I call educated? First, those who manage well the circumstances they encounter day by day. Next, those who are decent and honorable in their intercourse with all men, bearing easily and good naturedly what is offensive in others and being as agreeable and reasonable to their associates as is humanly possible to be... those who hold their pleasures always under control and are not ultimately overcome by their misfortunes... those who are not spoiled by their successes, who do not desert their true selves but hold their ground steadfastly as wise and sober -- minded men.\tWisdom, Niko thought as he leaned his cheek against his long-handled rake, cannot be had without price.\tWithout education, you're not going anywhere in this world.\tYou can always tell a Harvard man, but you can't tell him much.\tYou can lead a boy to college, but you cannot make him to think.\t\u201cI want to be able to touch every part of our community with poetry.\u201d", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.02jfc", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
