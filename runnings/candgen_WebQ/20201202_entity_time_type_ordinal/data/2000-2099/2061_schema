Why this has to happen, we do not know; the work of Eros is precisely this.\tConscience is the internal perception of the rejection of a particular wish operating within us.\tDevout believers are safeguarded in a high degree against the risk of certain neurotic illnesses; their acceptance of the universal neurosis spares them the task of constructing a personal one.\tEvery normal person, in fact, is only normal on the average. His ego approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent.\tFlowers are restful to look at. They have neither emotions nor conflicts.\tFrom error to error, one discovers the entire truth.\tHe that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.\tHuman life in common is only made possible when a majority comes together which is stronger than any separate individual and which remains united against all separate individuals. The power of this community is then set up as right in opposition to the power of the individual, which is condemned as brute force.\tI cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.\tI do not think our successes can compete with those of Lourdes. There are so many more people who believe in the miracles of the Blessed Virgin than in the existence of the unconscious.\tI have found little that is good about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.\tI have no concern with any economic criticisms of the communist system; I cannot inquire into whether the abolition of private property is expedient or advantageous. But I am able to recognize that the psychological premisses on which the system is based are an untenable illusion. In abolishing private property we deprive the human love of aggression of one of its instruments... but we have in no way altered the differences in power and influence which are misused by aggressiveness.\tIf a man has been his mother's undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling, the confidence in success, which not seldom brings actual success along with it.\tIt is always possible to bind together a considerable number of people in love, so long as there are other people left over to receive the manifestations of their aggression.\tIt might be said of psychoanalysis that if you give it your little finger it will soon have your whole hand.\tIt would be one of the greatest triumphs of humanity, one of the most tangible liberations from the constraints of nature to which mankind is subject, if we could succeed in raising the responsible act of procreating children to the level of a deliberate and intentional activity and in freeing it from its entanglement with the necessary satisfaction of a natural need.\tJust as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.\tLook into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you and perhaps you will thenceforth avoid falling ill.\tLove and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.\tMan has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs, he is truly magnificent; but those organs have not grown on him and they still give him much trouble at times.\tMen are more moral than they think and far more immoral than they can imagine.\tMost people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.\tNeurotics complain of their illness, but they make the most of it, and when it comes to talking it away from them they will defend it like a lioness her young.\tNo one who has seen a baby sinking back satiated from the breast and falling asleep with flushed cheeks and a blissful smile can escape the reflection that this picture persists as a prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life.\tOne feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of Creation.\tOne is very crazy when in love.\tOpposition is not necessarily enmity; it is merely misused and made an occasion for enmity.\tOur knowledge of the historical worth of certain religious doctrines increases our respect for them, but does not invalidate our proposal that they should cease to be put forward as the reasons for the precepts of civilization. On the contrary! Those historical residues have helped us to view religious teachings, as it were, as neurotic relics, and we may now argue that the time has probably come, as it does in an analytic treatment, for replacing the effects of repression by the results of the rational operation of the intellect.\tSexual love is undoubtedly one of the chief things in life, and the union of mental and bodily satisfaction in the enjoyment of love is one of its culminating peaks. Apart from a few queer fanatics, all the world knows this and conducts its life accordingly; science alone is too delicate to admit it.\tThe act of birth is the first experience of anxiety, and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety.\tThe analytic psychotherapist thus has a threefold battle to wage -- in his own mind against the forces which seek to drag him down from the analytic level; outside the analysis, against opponents who dispute the importance he attaches to the sexual instinctual forces and hinder him from making use of them in his scientific technique; and inside the analysis, against his patients, who at first behave like opponents but later on reveal the overvaluation of sexual life which dominates them, and who try to make him captive to their socially untamed passion.\tThe conscious mind may be compared to a fountain playing in the sun and falling back into the great subterranean pool of subconscious from which it rises.\tThe doctor should be opaque to his patients and, like a mirror, should show them nothing but what is shown to him.\tThe ego is not master in its own house.\tThe expectation that every neurotic phenomenon can be cured may, I suspect, be derived from the layman's belief that the neuroses are something quite unnecessary which have no right whatever to exist. Whereas in fact they are severe, constitutionally fixed illnesses, which rarely restrict themselves to only a few attacks but persist as a rule over long periods throughout life.\tThe goal towards which the pleasure principle impels us -- of becoming happy -- is not attainable: yet we may not -- nay, cannot -- give up the efforts to come nearer to realization of it by some means or other.\tThe great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is What does a woman want?\tThe impression forces itself upon one that men measure by false standards, that everyone seeks power, success, riches for himself, and admires others who attain them, while undervaluing the truly precious thing in life.\tThe liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization.\tThe mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water.\tThe most complicated achievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness.\tThe only bodily organ which is really regarded as inferior is the atrophied penis, a girl's clitoris.\tThe psychoanalysis of individual human beings, however, teaches us with quite special insistence that the god of each of them is formed in the likeness of his father, that his personal relation to God depends on his relation to his father in the flesh and oscillates and changes along with that relation, and that at bottom God is nothing other than an exalted father.\tThe tendency of aggression is an innate, independent, instinctual disposition in man... it constitutes the most powerful obstacle to culture.\tThe time comes when each one of us has to give up as illusions the expectations which, in his youth, he pinned upon his fellow-men, and when he may learn how much difficulty and pain has been added to his life by their ill-will.\tWe are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never so forlornly unhappy as when we have lost our love object or its love.\tWe are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world, which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations to other men. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful than any other.\tWe have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality.\tWe know less about the sexual life of little girls than of boys. But we need not feel ashamed of this distinction; after all, the sexual life of adult women is a dark continent for psychology.\tWe must reckon with the possibility that something in the nature of the sexual instinct itself is unfavorable to the realization of complete satisfaction.\tWhat progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books.\tWhere id was, there shall ego be.\tWoe to you, my Princess, when I come... you shall see who is the stronger, a gentle little girl who doesn't eat enough or a big wild man who has cocaine in his body.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.06myp", ["people.person.quotations"]]]}

He recommended its anesthetic properties and suggested its use in opthamology. His friend ^a pal of^ Koller was recognized for pioneering the use of cocaine as a local anaesthetic in ophthalmic work)\tAmong the members over the years were Alfred Adler and Lou Salome.\tAs thefounder of psychoanalysis he is credited not only with its introduction to medicine but also to the psychological viewpoint which now colors all the arts, our interpretation of history, and every area of human society from politics and sociology to warfare and marketing.\tAt the end of the decade he published two books pioneering the psychology of the ego: \"\"Analysis of the Ego\"\" and: \"\"The Ego and the Id\"\".\tAt this time he heard about the work of Breuer, who was privately treating a neurotic patient by the innovative method of encouraging her to relive traumatic memories under hypnosis.\tAt university Freud worked under the physiologist Brucke who was a follower of the materialist philosophy ofHelmholtz.\tConscience, he held, was the result of tension between the ego and the superego.\tDuring his research at the physiological laboratory, Freud worked on histology (the study of the structure of tissues).\tExamining the content of the unconscious mind, he concluded that it was essentially infantile and he held that the driving forces were sexual and antagonistic feelings about parents.\tFreud concluded that many of these apparently insignificant acts are driven by wishes and conflicts hidden from the conscious mind.\tFreud is one of the most important figures of the twentieth century.\tFreud realized he had to make a career and took a job as a clinical assistant at the General Hospital in Vienna.\tFreud used hypnotism in his practice for treating hysterical patients but was not satisfied with the results.\tFreud was also using Breuer's method of encouraging patients to relive bad memories.\tGalton's word-association pre-dated his free-association.\tHe investigated the structure of nerve cells and then moved on to microscopic examination of the human nervous system.\tHe isolated various mechanisms of the unconscious mind, like repression and displacement, and linked these to the drives, impulses and desires the conscious mind does not wish to acknowledge.\tHe proposed a division of the mind into the id (the unconscious), the ego (the conscious mind) and the superego (an ego ideal which embodies parental standards and demands, and is responsible for inducing guilt).\tHis main interest was psychiatry, which he studied under the Theodor Meynert.\tHis methods were radical and he began to form conclusions which upset the medical establishment, particularly when he stated that certain psychoneuroses were caused by unconscious sexual conflicts.\tHis most important work in the next few years was on the nature and origin of anxiety and fear in: \"\"Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety\"\" (1925).\tIn 1882 he fell in love with Martha Bernays, the daughter of a prominent Hamburg family.\tIn 1885, Freud went to the Salpetriere mental hospital in Paris where he studied for several months under the famous neurologist, ^taught by^ Charcot^  who was using hypnosis in his study of hysterics,  and Freud was stimulated to switch from the physical aspects of neurology to the psychological.\tIn 1886 Freud married and set up his own practice as a neurologist.\tIn 1889 he went to France to consult Dr Hippolyte Bernheim who had been introduced to the use of hypnotism by Liebault.\tIn 1895 Freud and Breuer published \"\"Studies in Hysteria\"\".\tIn 1900 he published what is regarded by many as his most important work: \"\"The Interpretation of Dreams\"\" about the significance of dreams and the functioning of the unconscious mind.\tIn 1902 Freud set up the Wednesday Psychological Discussion Group.\tIn 1904 Freud published \"\"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life\"\".\tIn 1905 he published three books.\tIn 1906 Carl Jung, the Swiss analyst, announced his acceptance of Freud's views.\tIn 1913 Freud published \"\"Totem and Taboo\"\" (regarded as second in importance only to his book on dreams) which explored reactions to incest and parricide and revealed a link between the governing impulses in children and primitive men.\tIn 1938,  accompanied by his daughter Anna, and his couch, Freud left the famous consulting rooms at 19 Bergasse,  where he had practised since 1891, to settle in Hampstead, London, where he continued to practice and write until a month before his death.\tIt is an account of the many ways in which we express the hidden layers of our thoughts by imperfect mental functioning such as slips of the tongue, spelling a word wrongly, or forgetting.\tIt was the following year that Freud coined the term 'psychoanalysis' for his method of treating patients.\tOne of his patients was the composer Gustav Mahler.\tOver the next few years, Freud abandoned the use of hypnotism and developed his own method of \"\"free association,\"\" encouraging the patient to say whatever came into their mind as one thought followed another, through association.\tThe \"\"Dora Analysis\"\" (1905) is an account of how the interpretations of dreams could be useful in the treatment of neuroses.\tThe Oedipus complex is the most well-known example of this theory: sexual desire for one parent is united with jealous hatred of the other parent.\tThis theory of disguised wish-fulfilment was one of Freud's most important contributions to psychology.\tUnlike his book on dreams, this one became popular.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.06myp",
