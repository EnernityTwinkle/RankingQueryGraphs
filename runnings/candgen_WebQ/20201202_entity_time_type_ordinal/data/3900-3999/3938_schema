the view that most diseases are caused by disorders in the blood.\tAfter leaving high school Virchow was accepted for free medical training at the Friedrich-Wilhems Institute at Berlin University where Muller was dean.\tAmong his better known students were the anatomists Hensen and Haeckel.\tDuring his time at Wurzburg the reputation of its medical school was re-established and the number of its pupils increased dramatically.\tDuring the seven years he spent at Wurzburg Virchow also began his anthropological studies on skulls.\tDuring the uprisings of 1848 he fought on the side of the revolutionaries at the barricades and published a weekly paper (\"\"The Reform of Medicine\"\").\tHe coined the term \"\"thrombosis\"\" which he demonstrated as a cause of clotting in blood vessels and he showed that when a piece of a thrombus became detached to form what he called an \"\"embolus\"\" it could travel through the circulation and could block a narrow blood vessel.\tHe conducted a nationwide racial survey of school children which was the first of its kind.\tHe declared his own belief that research should be based on experiment and observation,  which should include microscopy and post-mortems.\tHe dismissed any idea of spontaneous generation and urged his audience to concentrate on the cell as the basic unit of study.\tHe graduated in 1843 and an attempt to make him clinical pathologist at the Charite hospital was blocked by Schoenlein who wanted to appoint his pupil Remak.\tHe oversaw the design of two new hospitals in the city, opened a school for nurses and designed Berlin's new sewer system.\tHe visited Britain regularly where he formed a friendship with the surgeon Lister and had tea with the poet Robert Browning.\tHe was one of the founders of the German Anthropological Society.\tHe worked for German- Franco reconciliation and was an enthusiastic admirer of Pasteur.\tHis view that disease arose primarily in the individual cells of organs and tissues led to a growth in surgery and became a stimulus for modern chemotherapy.\tHis views changed the concept of biology and many progressive medical men, like the Italian physician Lombroso and the American psychiatrist William James, were inspired by his writing and teaching.\tIn 1845 Virchow published an important paper in which he reported on one of the earliest known cases of leukemia.\tIn 1848 he was sent to Upper Silesia on behalf of the Prussian government to investigate an outbreak of typhus fever.\tIn 1849 he moved to Wurzburg where he became the first professor of pathological anatomy in Germany.\tIn 1854 he began publication of his six-volume \"\"Handbook of  Special Pathology and Therapeutics\"\".\tIn 1856 he returned to Berlin where a chair of pathological anatomy was established for him.\tIn 1858 he published his theory in \"\"Cellular Pathology as Based upon Physiological and Pathological Histology\"\".\tIn 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council,  where he focussed on public health issues and was responsible for reforms in areas which included sewage disposal, meat inspection and school hygiene.\tIn 1865 Bismarck attempted to end Virchow's attacks by challenging him to a duel, an offer which Virchow declined to accept.\tIn 1875 he was excavating hill forts in East Prussia and found himself working next to Koch with whom he later fell out over their different views on bacteriology.\tIn 1880 he was elected to the Reichstag (the German Parliament) and two years later was made President of the Berlin Medical Society.\tIn 1881 Virchow made his first visit to the Caucasus, which since the time of the German  anthropologist Blumenbach had been declared the cradle of the bronze culture.\tIn the same year he addressed a distinguished audience at the medical institute and stated his rejection of  the prevalent idea (held by most of those present) that the human system was dependent on a balance of four vital fluids, the so-called \"\"humors\"\".\tIn these views, Virchow was influenced by the work of  Schwann, another ex-pupil of Muller, and Schleiden, a botanist who had stated in 1837 that all plants consist of cells.\tOn the medical front, he conducted investigations on the process of inflammation, the pathology of tumours and the role of animal parasites in causing disease in humans.\tSilesia was a Prussian province inhabited by a poor Polish minority and Virchow's report concluded that the causes of the outbreak were the social conditions,  which he blamed on the government.\tThe theory of cellular pathology which Virchov arrived at stimulated new research and made the subject a key area of investigation.\tTo promote the progressive views he held, Virchow co-founded and edited a new medical journal (\"\"Archives for Pathological Anatomy and Physiology, and for Clinical Medicine\"\").\tVirchov was influenced by new advances in cellular pathology, such as the work of Remak,  who in 1852 was the first to notice that cells multiplied by division.\tVirchow also took up his political interests again.\tVirchow discovered that Caucasian culture was not primary.\tVirchow disproved the commonly held view that phlebitis (inflammation of a vein) was the cause of most diseases.\tVirchow was a co-founder of the German Progressive Party and in 1861 he was elected to the Prussian Parliament,  where he led the fight against the militaristic German unification programme of the prime minister of Bismarck.\tVirchow was a personal friend of Schliemann  (who discovered the site of Troy)  and was instrumental in persuading Schliemann to bequeath his collection of antiquities to Berlin.\tVirchow was enthusiastic about educating the public and in 1868 co-founded the series \"\"Collection of Popular Scientific Lectures\"\" for which he wrote several papers.\tVirchow was much in demand internationally and was a leading figure at medical congresses in all the European capitals.\tWeigert and Kuhne were his assistants Morgagni laid the ground for his work.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.011kz4",
