Cockcroft and Ernest Walton in 1932 to construct the world's first particle accelerator, and thereby demonstrate the transmutation of elements by  artificial means.\tAt his suggestion, the name \"\"proton\"\"  was given to the hydrogen nucleus in 1920.\tBlackett showed that the bombardment of alpha particles combined with the nucleus before disintegration, and did not break the nucleus apart like a bullet.\tCounting the particles with the use of the electric  radiation \"\"Geiger\"\" counter, they divided the total charge produced by the number of particles counted, and arrived at the  conclusion that each particle had two positive charges.\tDeflection of the rays in electric and magnetic fields proved they were positive particles.\tDuring the First World War, Rutherford, serving in the British Navy's Board of Invention and Research, worked on methods of detecting German U-boats (submarines) by underwater acoustics.\tDuring the War, Rutherford's also continued to work at Manchester.\tEarlier, in 1900, Bequerel had identified beta rays with cathode rays, which were shown to be electrons.\tFoil made from metals with a large atomic number (such as lead) reflected back even more particles.\tFrom this research, Rutherford and Soddy in 1903 were able to put together the modern understanding of radioactivity.\tHe also showed that bombardment with alpha particles had its limits, finding that large nuclei repelled them without disintegrating.\tHe and Edward Andrade, by diffracting them with a crystal, showed that gamma rays were electromagnetic waves.\tHe concluded that uranium emitted two distinct types of radiation, which he named \"\"alpha rays\"\" -- highly powerful in producing ionization, but easily absorbed -- and \"\"beta rays\"\" -- producing less radiation but having more penetrating ability.\tHe deduced that each contained a positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons: only that kind of nucleus could repulse the positively charged alpha particles that happened to strike them and produce such enormous deflections.\tHe knew Balfour.\tHe taught Bragg.\tHe was sure they consisted of positively charged particles and specifically either hydrogen or helium ions.\tHe worked with CP Snow.\tHere he turned from uranium to thorium -- another radioactive element -- which he found produced an intensely radioactive gas, a new radioactive substance that he called \"\"emanation\"\".\tHis atomic model was anticipated by Lenard.\tHis results were used later in Langevin's development of sonar.\tHis work related to that of  Marie Curie and Ramsay.\tHowever, he later observed the same effect when alpha particles were fired into nitrogen.\tIn 1897 Rutherford took up the study of radioactivity, discovered in 1896 by French physicist Becquerel.\tIn 1898, Rutherford accepted a professorship in physics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, considered to have the best-equipped laboratory in the world.\tIn 1900 Rutherford and his associate Soddy isolated the active part of radioactive thorium, which they named thorium-X, from the apparently-inert parent thorium.\tIn 1900, he also observed what was described by French physicist Paul Villard as \"\"gamma\"\" radiation, the  most penetrating type of all.\tIn 1904, with Bertram Boltwood, Rutherford worked out the series of transformations that radioactive elements go through and suggested that those with extremely long half-lives might provide a source of energy for sustaining the heat of the Earth's interior.\tIn 1906, he accepted the chair of professor of physics at Manchester University in England, where he built up a renowned laboratory and a group of talented associates including Geiger,  and physicist Bohr.\tIn 1914, he found that positive rays consist of hydrogen nuclei.\tIn 1919, Rutherford succeeded Thomson as director of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.\tIn early 1896 Thomson asked Rutherford to help him study the effects of Roentgen's X-rays on the discharge of electricity in gases.\tIt was not until more than a year later that Rutherford felt he had enough evidence to postulate the modern concept of the atom, which he announced early in 1911.\tMeasuring the  wavelengths of the rays, they found that they lay beyond X-rays in the electromagnetic spectrum.\tMost renowned achievement was demonstrating that the atom consisted of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons.\tPursuing earlier work in which scintillations were noticed in hydrogen bombarded by alpha particles well beyond their range in the gas, Rutherford first concluded that the scintillations were being caused by hydrogen nuclei.\tRutherford became the first research student to work under English physicist J.J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory.\tRutherford demonstrated that X-rays broke gas molecules into electrically charged particles, or ions, of positive and negative electricity, which recombined to form neutral molecules.\tRutherford first studied the radioactive emissions of uranium, systematically wrapping uranium in successive layers of aluminum foil to observe the emissions' penetrating ability.\tRutherford found similar results with other elements  and  announced that the nucleus of any atom must be composed of hydrogen nuclei .\tRutherford now began to investigate the nature of alpha rays.\tRutherford returned to full research in 1919, when he made his last great discovery.\tRutherford was now sought by such gifted associates as Otto Hahn, a German physicist who would demonstrate the fissioning of uranium in 1939.\tRutherford's explanation of radioactivity at the atomic level caused a sensation in scientific circles: the idea that  atoms could change their identity was revolutionary.\tRutherford's next major discovery came in 1909.\tThe final proof  that  alpha particles were helium ions came also in 1908, when Rutherford trapped alpha particles in a glass tube and, by sparking the gas that was produced, showed from its spectrum that it was helium.\tThe positive charge on the nucleus would therefore be balanced by an equal charge on all the electrons orbiting the nucleus.\tThe process entailed firing alpha particles into a nearly evacuated tube with a strong electric field.\tThe resulting ionizing effect in the gas could be detected not only by an electrometer (a device that measured electric charge in a gas), but visually (as the alpha particles struck a zinc sulfide screen, they caused an identifiable flash, or  \"\"scintillation\"\").\tThey charted how thorium-X gradually lost its radioactivity, while the original thorium regained its  activity, illustrating that thorium-X had its own distinctive half-life, much shorter than the half-life of thorium.\tThis convinced Rutherford that the explanation must lie in the nature of the metal atoms in the foil.\tThis was a decay product of thorium, and Rutherford also observed that the radioactivity of \"\"emanation\"\" gradually decreased geometrically with time, an occurrence now known as the half-life of a radioactive substance -- the measurement of the time it takes for half of a substance to decay.\tThis work would earn Rutherford the 1908 Nobel Prize in  chemistry.\tThis would offer a means for estimating the age of the  Earth.\tThroughout the 30s, Rutherford maintained close contact with leading world scientists, in particular,  physicists Bohr,  Planck, Einstein and Fermi.\tUnder Rutherford's direction, English physicist Patrick Blackett in 1925 used the cloud chamber  apparatus, developed by Scottish physicist C.T.R. Wilson, to record the tracks of disintegrated nuclei.\tUsing a scintillation counter that could be moved around the foil, which was struck by a beam of alpha particles from a radon source,  it was observed that when alpha particles were fired at gold foil, a significant number were deflected through angles of more than 90 degrees, and some particles were deflected backwards.\tUsing their own invention, an apparatus using ionization chambers and scintillation screens, Rutherford and Geiger came up with a method for counting alpha particles precisely.\tWorking alone, Rutherford then developed a technique for measuring  the velocity and rate of recombination of these positive and negative ions.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.02m7r", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
