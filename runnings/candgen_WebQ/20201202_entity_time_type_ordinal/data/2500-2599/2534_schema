Lee was back in Texas and commissioned full colonel and commander of the First Cavalry on 16th March 1861.\tLee could only place his starving men in defensive lines in front of Petersburg and Richmond.\tLee finally saw active service, when he joined Major General Winfield Scott in January 1847, during the Mexican War of 1846 to 1848.\tLee himself was physically declining and frequently ill.\tLee succeeded in restoring the college as a model for higher education in the South.\tNow a Lieutenant Colonel, he left the Academy to take command of the Second Cavalry, with which he did several tours of duty in the South, especially in Texas and Mexico.\tOn 28th September 1870, Lee suffered what was probably a heart attack and died at daybreak on 12th October.\tOn 31st May, the leader of the Confederate troops opposing McClellan, General Johnston, was wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks, seven miles east of Richmond and Lee took over field command.\tOn April 18th he was called to Washington and offered command of a new army being formed to force the Confederate states back into the Union.\tOn the same day, Virginia seceded and Lee, out of loyalty to his family and homeland, resigned from the army after 36 years of service.\tRobert Edward Lee was born on the Stratford estate in Westmoreland County, Virginia, the son of Ann Hill Carter and Henry \"\"Light Horse Harry\"\" Lee,  a famous cavalry leader during the American Revolution and Governor of Virginia from 1792 to 1795.\tThe month before, Texas had become the seventh Southern state to secede from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America and, with the rest of the Union forces, he was ordered out of the state.\tThere, Lee courted Custis' daughter, Mary Anne Randolph Custis, whom he was to marry two years later.\tThis action had the strategic advantage of diverting essential troops from Army of the Potomac Major General McClellan's offensive against Richmond, the Confederate capital.\tWithin three weeks Lee had organized Confederate troops into what became the famed Army of Northern Virginia.\tWorking independently of Davis, however, Lee introduced a coherent strategy into the Confederate army,  and was able to reinforce Major General 'Stonewall' Jackson's army sufficiently to undertake a surprise attack on Federal troops in the Shenandoah Valley, 8th May-9th June 1862.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.06f5j", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
