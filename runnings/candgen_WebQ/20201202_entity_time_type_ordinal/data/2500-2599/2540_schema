where he  also met artists Renoir and Alfred Sisley.\tAfter the war, in 1871, Monet spent several months near Amsterdam before returning to Paris.\tApart from doing a series of paintings in Venice in 1908 and 1909, Monet worked mostly out of Giverny, devoting his time to painting his garden.\tAt a studio exhibition in 1865, two of Monet's relatively conventional seascapes were hung on either side of  Manets nude \"\"Olympia,\"\" which was the scandal of the show.\tBetween 1916 and 1925, he created a series of water-lily paintings, called \"\"Nymphaeus\"\", which are the most triumphant expression of his art.\tBetween January and April of 1877, Monet painted 12 pictures of the Gare St. Lazare.\tBut he still wanted to create his large picture.\tBut shortly before the show, he decided to submit  two other pictures,  which were well received.\tDelacroix, Corot and Courbet had all worked there, and Pissarro was a fellow student.\tEven before the Council made its decision, Monet had already left for Paris, where he became so taken with the \"\"Barbizon\"\" landscape painters -- who, to his amazement, painted outdoors -- and other avant-garde artists that he changed his mind about enrolling at the Ecole des-Beaux-Arts, the official arts academy.\tHe also went to Bordighera in Italy,  and to the Netherlands to paint the tulip fields.\tHe completed the series in 1904.\tHe decided on a more modest effort, scaled down the size a little, and reduced the number of figures, but he still had an eight-foot canvas, which he called \"\"Women in the Garden\"\".\tHe had signed up for seven years, but in less than a year, he was sent home with typhoid.\tHe knew Valery Gauguin bought his work He met Sickert.\tHe painted on the beaches and produced works so spontaneously-done that there were bits of shell and sand embedded in the paint.\tHe painted windmills and boats on the canals and produced 24  works in four months.\tHe proposed to paint the figures life-size in natural light.\tHe then  returned to Paris.\tHe was known particularly for his caricatures, but the Havre town council refused to grant him a scholarship because it felt he was not a serious artist.\tHis aunt bought him out of the army.\tHis best known work from this period is \"\"Terrace at Sainte-Adresse\"\" (1867).\tHoschede's wife Alice already felt a kinship with Monet, and when Camille died in 1879, she and her six children moved in with Monet.\tIn 1861, at 21, Monet was called for army service, enlisting in a cavalry regiment that was being sent to Algeria.\tIn 1870, when war with the Prussians was imminent, Monet with his family to Trouville, which would allow a crossing to England if necessary.\tIn 1878, Monet moved his family to Vertheuil on the Seine, further away from Paris.\tIn 1883, Monet, his two sons and Alice and her children moved to a farmhouse at Giverny on the Epte river, some 50 miles from Paris.\tIn 1899, Monet went to London and embarked on a series of paintings of the Thames, including the Houses of Parliament and the Waterloo and Charing Cross bridges.\tIn the autumn, Monet took his family to live in London.\tInfluenced Braque and Debussy^ Clemenceau^?\tInstead, with money from his father, he enroled in the Suisse studio, a liberal studio with no formal curriculum.\tIntent on showing the everyday scenes of bathing and boating, they spontaneously began using a new painting technique: the brushstrokes became broader and shorter and the colors brighter and more pure.\tLight coming off the water, the movement and texture of the water,  the different colors in the water were all to become trademarks of Monet's work.\tMonet still continued to pursue his vision, working outdoors in Paris, Le Havre and other coastal sites like Honfleur and Trouville.\tMonet was determined to eclipse Manet, and for the 1866 show he proposed to submit a huge work, painted outdoors as the Barbizons did,  showing picnickers in the forest of Fontainebleau.\tMonet's pictures were dominated more by water than figures, while Renoir's were the opposite.\tMonet, now 26, was gaining a reputation as a good Salon painter.\tMuch of the painting was done in or near the station.\tOne of the artists who initiated the technique used in Impressionist art, Monet remained faithful to Impressionism throughout his painting career.\tShe owned a small studio where Monet painted and by the time he was 18, he was already selling his work.\tThe Salon rejected it outright in 1867.\tThe station-master was a model of cooperation.\tThe work of Monet and Renoir La Grenouillere is considered the birth of Impressionism.\tThey set up their easels side by side at La Grenouillere,  a fashionable picnic and bathing place.\tThey shared a large house with Ernest Hoschede, a once-prosperous but now failed businessman, who earlier had employed Monet to provide decorative paintings for his chateau in the country.\tThrough the 1880's, he painted in various locations in Normandy, Brittany and in the south of France at Menton and Antibes.\tTo make ends meet, Monet sketched the concierges in the area,  and even sold a painting his aunt had lent him -- a work by Charles Daubigny, a Barbizon artist.\tTrains were stopped, platforms were emptied and engines were stoked up to give out as much smoke as Monet desired.\tZola, reviewed the paintings at the third Impressionist Exhibition of 1877 and called them superb.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.01xnj",
