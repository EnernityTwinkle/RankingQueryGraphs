Anyone can live sweetly, patiently, lovingly, purely, until the sun goes down. And this is all that life really means.\tBelieve that each day that shines on you is your last.\tChildren have neither a past nor a future. Thus they enjoy the present -- which seldom happens to us.\tConfine yourself to the present\tEach day is a special gift from God, and while life may not always be fair, you must never allow the pains, hurdles, and handicaps of the moment to poison your attitude and plans for yourself and your future. You can never win when you wear the ugly cloak of self-pity, and the sour sound of whining will certainly frighten away any opportunity for success. Never again. There is a better way.\tEvery day is just one day.\tFinish each day before you begin the next, and interpose a solid wall of sleep between the two. This you cannot do without temperance.\tGive me insight into today and you may have the antique and future worlds.\tHe to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives.\tI have a new philosophy. I'm only going to dread one day at a time.\tI try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That's were the fun is.\tIf it were not for the presents, an elopement would be preferable.\tIn the nineteenth century the problem was that God is dead. In the twentieth century the problem is that man is dead.\tLearn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.\tLive in the present. The past is gone; the future is unknown -- but the present is real, and your opportunities are now. You must see these opportunities; they must be real for you. The catch is that they can't seem real if your mind is buried in past failures, if you keep reliving old mistakes, old guilts, old tragedies. Fight your way above the many inevitable Traumatizations of your ego, escape damnation by the past, and look to the opportunities of the present. I don't mean some vague moment in the present -- next week or next month, perhaps. I mean today, this minute.\tLive one day at a time emphasizing ethics rather than rules.\tLook well to this day, for it, and it alone is life.\tNo matter what looms ahead, if you can eat today, enjoy the sunlight today, mix good cheer with friends today, enjoy it and bless God for it. Do not look back on happiness -- or dream of it in the future. You are only sure of today; do not let yourself be cheated out of it.\tNothing is worth more than this day. You cannot relive yesterday. Tomorrow is still beyond your reach\tNow is the operative word. Everything you put in your way is just a method of putting off the hour when you could actually be doing your dream. You don't need endless time and perfect conditions. Do it now. Do it today. Do it for twenty minutes and watch your heart start beating.\tOne today is worth two tomorrows.\tOur main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what clearly lies at hand.\tPresent-moment living, getting in touch with your now, is at the heart of effective living. When you think about it, there really is no other moment you can live. Now is all there is, and the future is just another present moment to live when it arrives. One thing is certain, you cannot live it until it does appear.\tRemember, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.\tSeize the day.\tSince Time is not a person we can overtake when he is gone, let us honor him with mirth and cheerfulness of heart while he is passing.\tStop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.\tThe obscurest epoch is to-day.\tThe pleasure we derive from the representation of the present is due, not only to the beauty it can be clothed in, but also to its essential quality of being the present.\tThe present is the ever moving shadow that divides yesterday from tomorrow. In that lies hope.\tThe secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, not to worry about the future, or not to anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.\tThere exists only the present instant... a Now which always and without end is itself new. There is no yesterday nor any tomorrow, but only Now, as it was a thousand years ago and as it will be a thousand years hence.\tThere is never time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment; the time is always now.\tThere is only one time that is important -- NOW! It is the most important time because it is the only time hat we have any power.\tThose who live to the future must always appear selfish to those who live to the present.\tTime past and time future what might have been and what has been point to one end, which is always present.\tTo live is so starling it leaves little time for anything else.\tTo those leaning on the sustaining infinite, today is big with blessings.\tToday is a king in disguise.\tToday is life-the only life you are sure of. Make the most of today. Get interested in something. Shake yourself awake. Develop a hobby. Let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you. Live today with gusto.\tToday is the first day of the rest of your life.\tToday is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.\tToday is yesterday's pupil.\tToday must not borrow from tomorrow.\tTrust no future, however pleasant! Let the dead past bury its dead! Act -- act in the living Present! Heart within and God overhead.\tWe can live forever, a minute at a time.\tWe convince by our presence.\tWe shall be better prepared for the future if we see how terrible, how doomed the present is.\tWe usually lose today, because there has been a yesterday, and tomorrow is coming.\tWe were wise indeed, could we discern truly the signs of our own time; and by knowledge of its wants and advantages, wisely adjust our own position in it. Let us, instead of gazing idly into the obscure distance, look calmly around us, for a little, on the perplexed scene where we stand. Perhaps, on a more serious inspection, something of its perplexity will disappear, some of its distinctive characters and deeper tendencies more clearly reveal themselves; whereby our own relations to it, our own true aims and endeavors in it, may also become clearer.\tWhat is not started today is never finished tomorrow.\tWhere were you... when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons (and daughters) of God shouted for joy? -- 4-7, Job 38:}\tWrite down the thoughts of the moment. Those that come unsought for are commonly the most valuable.\tYou must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.\tlabor not after riches first, and think thou afterwards wilt enjoy them.
