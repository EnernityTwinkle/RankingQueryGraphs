Bartholin.\tIn 1543 the Polish astronomer Copernicus had published a book which challenged the Ptolemaic view of a geocentric universe but even Copernican astronomical tables were not precise (they were several days out on the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn).\tIn 1586 his portrait was engraved by De Gheyn.\tIn 1595 the Dutch cartographer Blaeuw spent six months at Urania copying Brahe's unpublished stellar positions onto a celestial globe and making a map of the heavens.\tInfluenced by Regiomontanus.\tInfluenced by Witelo.\tIt was brighter than Venus and appeared in the constellation Casssiopeia.\tKepler became one of Brahe's assistants in Prague, as did the mathematician Snell.\tOn 11 November 1572 Brahe made his most famous astronomical observation when he saw a nova.\tPossibly anticipated by Reinhold.\tThe cornerstone of the new observatory of Hven was provided and laid by the French envoy to Denmark, De Dancay 1576 at a ceremony attended by many of Brahe's scholarly friends.\tThe following year, Brahe published his findings in \"\"De nova stella\"\".\tThey had the same disturbing effect as Copernicus's suggestion that the universe was sun-centered.\tThis divine order had for centuries been the symbol of harmony and perfection.\tThis was the first empirical evidence that change occurred in the sky.\tTo question it was considered blasphemous by many.\tWhen Frederick II found out that Brahe was proposing to site his observatory in Germany he induced him to stay in Denmark by giving him the island of Hven,  in the middle of the Danish Sound,  and enough lucrative sinecures to pay for the building works.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.07d2x", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
