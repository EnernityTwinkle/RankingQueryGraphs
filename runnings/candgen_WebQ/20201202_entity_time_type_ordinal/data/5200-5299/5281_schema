years, Paine became an excise officer.\tAs well as analyzing the reasons for discontent in European society, it outlined a plan for a rudimentary welfare state, financed by progressive taxation on property.\tAt least eight editions were published in one year and it was quickly reprinted in the U.S.  When Burke replied, Paine wrote \"\"The Rights of Man, Part the Second,\"\" published in 1792.\tAt the end of the war, Paine again found himself penniless.\tBetween 1777 and 1783, Paine served in a number of government posts, among them secretary to the commission appointed by Congress to negotiate with Indian tribes, and secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs.\tBut Paine was already on his way to France, where he had been elected to a seat in the National Convention.\tBut the Girondins were disbanded with the rise of the Jacobins under Robespierre, and Paine was arrested and imprisoned from December, 1793, to November, 1794.\tCobbett took his remains back to England (and lost them!).\tDuring the war, Paine served as volunteer aide-de-camp to General Nathanael Greene.\tGodwin helped to publish \"\"Rights\"\".\tHe arrived in September, 1792, in time to vote for the abolition of the monarchy.\tHe called for free trade, new taxes to help finance the war, and cooperation among the separate states for the well-being of the nation.\tHe read extensively on political theory, including the works of Priestley and James Burgh, both advocates of freedom of conscience and parliamentary reform.\tHis \"\"Public Good\"\", written in 1780, called for a national convention to establish a strong central government under \"\"a continental constitution\"\".\tHis \"\"Rights\"\" was attacked in print by Hannah More.\tHis household possessions were seized and sold at public auction.\tHis only published work in England was \"\"The Case of the Officers of Excise\"\" (1772), in which he argued that higher salaries for excise employees would get rid of corruption in the service.\tHowever, he discovered that his services to the country had all but been forgotten.\tIn 1774, Paine was fired from his excise job for being away without permission,  and went into debt.\tIn 1779, a controversy ( see Deane)  forced Paine to resign, but he continued to write pamphlets.\tIn 1791, Paine published his celebrated answer to Burke: \"\"The Rights of Man\"\".\tIn 1806, he was refused the right to vote because he was not an American citizen.\tIn Britain he met writer/politician Burke, but Burke's \"\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\"\", which criticized the French uprising, riled Paine and induced him to resume his political writing.\tIn December, 1792, he was tried, in absentia, in London, found guilty of seditious libel, and declared an outlaw.\tIn France,  by January, 1793 Paine had become appalled by the terror against the royalists and spoke in the Convention against the execution of Louis XVI.\tIn France, he met and became friends with U.S. ambassador Jefferson.\tIn January, 1776, Paine wrote \"\"Common Sense\"\", arguing that America should demand full independence.\tIn part, it was a vindication of events in France and in part an analysis of republican government.\tMore than any other individual, nurtured the radical mind and shaped the language of modern politics.\tPaine arrived in Philadelphia on Nov. 30, 1774.\tPaine called for a radical break with the past in Britain as well as in France.\tPaine joined a political discussion group, the White Hart Evening Club, where he made his mark as a public speaker.\tPaine turned his hand to inventions and, among other things, designed a wrought-iron single-arch bridge to cross the wide Schuylkill River near Philadelphia.\tPaine went to London, where a friend, George Lewis Scott, introduced him to U.S. diplomat Franklin, who gave him a letter of introduction to his son-in-law in America.\tSince he spoke little French, he joined the Girondin group (who spoke English, admired the American Revolution, and also opposed the execution).\tThe 1760s were a decade of rising prices, falling wages, and sporadic food riots.\tThe 50-page pamphlet  ended with the words, \"\"We have it in our power to begin the world over again\"\".\tThe British government banned the book, jailed its publisher, and indicted Paine for treason.\tThe Pennsylvania Assembly refused to give Paine any money for project, so in 1787, Paine went looking for funds in France and England.\tThe book created a sensation.\tThe tract became a central text of the British radical tradition.\tThe turn of fortune affected his marriage and he and his wife separated.\tTo boost American morale, Paine published in late 1776 \"\"The American Crisis,\"\" which opened with the famous words: \"\"These are the times that try men's souls\"\".\tWashington ordered the pamphlet read to all the troops at Valley Forge.\tWhen the Revolutionary war broke out in 1775, Paine took the revolutionary side, making friends with such independence advocates as Rush, future U.S. president John Quincy Adams, and Samuel Adams.\tWhile in prison, Paine completed \"\"The Age of Reason\"\", an attack on organized Christianity and the concept that the Bible was divinely inspired.\tWith Franklin's recommendation Paine soon found regular employment as editor at the \"\"Pennsylvania Magazine\"\".\tWith the fall of Robespierre, he was readmitted to the National Convention.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.07kwl", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
