S. Gilbert have remained as the most popular musical icons of his era.\tHis scholarship was extended for two more years, and he won the opportunity to study at the Leipzig Conservatory, as well.\tIn 1881 he built the Savoy Theatre, the first theater in London to be completely lit by electricity, to showcase the duo's operettas.\tIn 1885 he went to California to comfort his brother's recently-orphaned children and took on the responsibility of raising his nephew Herbert, who would eventually become his biographer.\tIn fact, Sullivan complained as early as 1884 that he felt musically stifled by their working relationship.\tIn the final decade of his life, Sullivan tried to rehabilitate his artistic career by composing a grand opera based on Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1891).\tOne person with whom he never shared a close friendship, however, was W. S. Gilbert.\tRichard D'Oyly Carte, one of the managers at the Royalty, took over promotion of the pair.\tShe also honored him with a memorial service at the Chapel Royal, St. James Palace, where the choir boys gave him a special salute.\tShortly afterward, Gilbert and Carte had a bitter legal battle over the management of the Savoy Theatre, and Sullivan took Carte's side in the dispute.\tSullivan became a fixture at gentlemen's clubs, aristocratic house parties, casinos, and horse races.\tSullivan conducted most of the opening performances, and was knighted in 1883 for his role in advancing the popularity of English music.\tSullivan continued writing music despite his increasingly poor health, composing patriotic tunes to help raise money for charities during the South African (Boer) War.\tSullivan died on November 22, 1900, of bronchitis and heart failure.\tSullivan enjoyed the first public performance of his work in July 1858, at the age of sixteen.\tSullivan first collaborated with the librettist W. S. Gilbert on a burlesque theater piece, Thespis (now lost), in 1871.\tSullivan helped care for Mary's father and had a close relationship with her children.\tSullivan was an art-music composer who considered comic opera and popular song to be a money-making diversion rather than a serious pursuit.\tTensions between them were high and the two quarreled fiercely during the creation of The Yeomen of the Guard in 1888.\tThanks to his outstanding talent as a singer, he won a post as a choirboy in the Chapel Royal from 1854-1857, where he received a more formal music education.\tThe opera took a serious toll on Carte's finances, however, and he was forced to sell one of his theaters.\tTheir last great success was The Gondoliers (1889).\tThis work caught the attention of English musicologist Grove, who would become one of Sullivan's closest friends despite the more than twenty-year age difference between them.\tUnder his management, Gilbert and Sullivan collaborated on The Sorceror (1877) and then the smash hit HMS Pinafore (1878).\tWhen it was produced outside of England, Ivanhoe was soundly panned by German critics, to Sullivan's great disappointment.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 3, "m.01vpcn5", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
