and he was conscripted into the army.\tBella was a frequent subject, as in The Birthday (1915), a portrait of the happy couple in which Chagall floats off the ground in a state of bliss.\tBella's brother,  a director of the Office of War Economy, arranged for Chagall to work for him as a clerk.\tBy the time of his exhibition in Basel, Switzerland in 1933, Chagall was hailed as a leading artist of the School of Paris.\tChagall approached the job with enthusiasm, but his art met with the disapproval of party bureaucrats.\tChagall dabbled in ceramics, sculpture, mosaics and tapestries, but became a master of stained glass.\tChagall designed the sets and costumes for the Paris Opera's production of Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe.\tChagall had his first solo exhibition in Berlin in 1914.\tChagall returned to France for the opening and then moved back permanently, settling in the south near Vence.\tChagall spent his childhood in Vitebsk, Belarus, a bustling town with a predominantly Jewish population.\tChagall studied with Penn for several months but soon tired of classical teaching methods.\tChagall was more interested in color than in geometry.\tChagall was part of a community of foreign-born artists that became known as the School of Paris.\tChagall was reluctant to leave France after the country fell to the Nazis, but when he was stripped of his French citizenship for being a Jew, he fled to the United States with Bella.\tHe also knew Leger.\tHe arrived in Paris in 1910 and became entranced by the city.\tHe became friends with the poet Apollinaire, who was a proponent of Cubism, but he resisted the Cubist influence.\tHe began aspiring to larger artistic expressions.\tHe emigrated to Berlin, where he was introduced to the art of printmaking and began engraving plates to accompany his memoir My Life.\tHe had his first retrospective exhibition in Paris in 1922, soon followed by others in Brussels and New York.\tHe intended to make an appearance at the opening before continuing on to Vitebsk, where he would marry his sweetheart, Bella Rosenberg, and return with her to Paris.\tHe is widely considered to be a 20th century master.\tHe lived near Montparnasse in an artists' colony called \"\"La Ruche,\"\" or \"\"Beehive,\"\" where his neighbors included Modigliani.\tHe moved to St. Petersburg in 1906 and enrolled at the Society for the Protection of the Arts, where he again found himself bored with copying Greek and Roman casts.\tHe offered Chagall a stipend to study in Paris, which Chagall eagerly accepted.\tHe opened an art school and museums and was in charge of art exhibitions.\tHe painted murals for the Watergate Theater in London and collaborated with Charles Marq to create stained glass windows for Metz Cathedral.\tHe remarried in 1952 and traveled widely in the years that followed, finding inspiration in the light and colors of Greece, Italy and the Middle East.\tHe then moved back to Paris, where he continued printmaking with commissions for Gogol's Dead Souls and La Fontaine's Fables.\tHe was appointed cultural commissar for the Vitebsk area.\tHe was commissioned by Malraux to paint the Paris Opera.\tHe was inspired to draw when he saw a classmate copying an illustration from a magazine.\tHe worked with Massine.\tHis Self-Portrait with Seven Fingers (1912) shows him dreaming of Vitebsk while working at a canvas, trying to paint his memories.\tHis father earned a meager living packing herring barrels while his mother kept a small shop for extra income.\tHis parents were reluctant to support his career choice, but a local artist named Jehuda Penn offered to teach him free.\tHis windows grace the United Nations building, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Cathedral at Rheims.\tHis work appeared in shows in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and by the time of the Revolution of 1917, Chagall had made his reputation as one of Russia's premier avant-garde artists.\tHis work took on a darker aspect in the 1930's as he witnessed the persecution of the Jews in Germany and Poland, which he represented in his White Crucifixion (1939).\tI and the Village (1911) features a man with a green face gazing into the eyes of a cow.\tIn 1908 he began studying with Leon Bakst, who was famous for his set and costume designs for the Ballet Russe.\tIn 1920 he moved to Moscow and designed sets for the Jewish National Theater.\tIn 1944, Chagall lost Bella to a throat infection.\tIn 1946 he had a retrospective exhibition in New York that moved on to Chicago and Paris.\tIn the background are houses, a church, a dancing peasant woman and a man carrying a scythe.\tIt was in Bakst's studio that Chagall became aware of artists such as Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh, and he began to dream of moving to Paris.\tMetropolitan Opera.\tNew York's Ballet Theater commissioned Chagall to create sets and costumes for several ballets, including Stravinsky's Firebird (1945).\tThe Chagall's were Hasidic Jews and their religion forbade representation of the human figure, so Chagall had little exposure to art as a child.\tThe man who made the dream a reality was Maxim Vinaver, a lawyer and deputy in the Parliament.\tThe themes of his paintings came from his childhood in Vitebsk and were rendered in a fantastical, dreamlike fashion.\tThey settled in New York, where they associated with other expatriate artists such as Leger and Mondrian.\tThis allowed him to paint, and his years in military service were some of his most productive as an artist.\tThough influenced by many of the artistic movements of his time (Cubism, Surrealism, Fauvism), Chagall developed and maintained a unique personal artistic style that he successfully translated into a wide variety of media.\tTwo years later he joined the exodus of Russian artists, musicians and writers to the West.\tVinaver took Chagall under his wing, even letting him use his office as a studio.\tWhen a friend who saw his sketches told him that he had real talent, Chagall decided to take lessons.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0g_j0",
