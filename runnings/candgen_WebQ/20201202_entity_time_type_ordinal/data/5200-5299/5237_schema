A thin book is useful to stick under a table with a broken caster to steady it. A large, flat atlas can be used to cover a window with a broken pane.

This is the law of custom, and custom supersedes all other forms of law.\tA good memory and a tongue tied in the middle is a combination which gives immortality to conversation.\tA habit cannot be tossed out the window; it must be coaxed down the stairs a step at a time.\tA jay hasnt got any more principle than a Congressman. A jay will lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and four times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise.\tA joke, even if it be a lame one, is nowhere so keenly relished or quickly applauded as in a murder trial.\tA lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants.\tA man can seldom -- very, very, seldom -- fight a winning fight against his training; the odds are too heavy.\tA man cannot be made comfortable without his own approval.\tA man never reaches that dizzy height of wisdom that he can no longer be lead by the nose.\tA man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way.\tA man's house burns down. The smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and pleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he misses this, then that, then the other thing. And when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an essential -- there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It was in that house. It is irrevocably lost. It will be years before the tale of lost essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know the magnitude of his disaster.\tA monarch, when good, is entitled to the consideration which we accord to a pirate who keeps Sunday School between crimes; when bad, he is entitled to none at all.\tA powerful agent is the right word.

This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.\tAn average English word is four letters and a half. By hard, honest labor I've dug all the large words out of my vocabulary and shaved it down till the average is three and a half... I never write metropolis for seven cents, because I can get the same money for city. I never write policeman, because I can get the same price for cop.... I never write valetudinarian at all, for not even hunger and wretchedness can humble me to the point where I will do a word like that for seven cents; I wouldn't do it for fifteen.\tAnnihilation has no terrors for me, because I have already tried it before I was born --a hundred million years --and I have suffered more in an hour, in this life, than I remember to have suffered in the whole hundred million years put together. There was a peace, a serenity, an absence of all sense of responsibility, an absence of worry, an absence of care, grief, perplexity; and the presence of a deep content and unbroken satisfaction in that hundred million years of holiday which I look back upon with a tender longing and with a grateful desire to resume, when the opportunity comes.\tAny so-called material thing that you want is merely a symbol: you want it not for itself, but because it will content your spirit for the moment.\tApparently there is nothing that cannot happen today.\tAs a thinker and planner the ant is the equal of any savage race of men; as a self-educated specialist in several arts she is the superior of any savage race of men; and in one or two high mental qualities she is above the reach of any man, savage or civilized!\tAs to the adjective, when in doubt strike it out.\tBarring that natural expression of villainy which we all have, the man looked honest enough.\tBe careful about reading health books.

The foundation of modern society. Who shall say that this is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon human promises? That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar newspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished speculator in lands and mines this remark: -- I wasn't worth a cent two years ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.\tBetween us, we cover all knowledge; he knows all that can be known and I know the rest.\tBiographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man.

Apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country.\tFrom his cradle to his grave a man never does a single thing which has any FIRST AND FOREMOST object but one -- to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort, for HIMSELF.\tGet your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.\tGolf is a good walk spoiled.\tGood breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person.\tGood friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life. The conviction of the rich that the poor are happier is no more foolish than the conviction of the poor that the rich are.\tGrief can take care of itself; but to get the full value of a joy you must have somebody to divide it with.\tHabit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time.\tHappiness ain't a thing in itself --it's only a contrast with something that ain't pleasant. And so, as soon as the novelty is over and the force of the contrast dulled, it ain't happiness any longer, and you have to get something fresh.\tHardly a man in the world has an opinion upon morals, politics or religion which he got otherwise than through his associations and sympathies. Broadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly speaking, Corn-Pone stands for Self-Approval. Self-approval is acquired mainly from the approval of other people. The result is Conformity.\tHe does not care for flowers.

Doubtless some people say they are, but this world is grievously given to lying.\tI am admonished in many ways that time is pushing me inexorably along. I am approaching the threshold of age; in 1977 I shall be 142. This is no time to be flitting about the earth. I must cease from the activities proper to youth and begin to take on the dignities and gravities and inertia proper to that season of honorable senility which is on its way.\tI am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.\tI am opposed to millionaires, but it would be dangerous to offer me the position.\tI believe that our Heavenly Father invented man because he was disappointed in the monkey.\tI can live for two months on a good compliment.\tI can teach anybody how to get what they want out of life.

But I wrote a very nice letter explaining that I approved of it.\tI repeat, sir, that in whatever position you place a woman she is an ornament to society and a treasure to the world. As a sweetheart, she has few equals and no superiors; as a cousin, she is convenient; as a wealthy grandmother with an incurable distemper, she is precious; as a wet-nurse, she has no equal among men. What, sir, would the people of the earth be without woman? They would be scarce, sir, almighty scarce.\tI think I can say, and say with pride, that we have some legislatures that bring higher prices than any in the world.\tI think a compliment ought to always precede a complaint, where one is possible, because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous and gentle reception.\tI was young and foolish then; now I am old and foolisher.\tI would rather have my ignorance than another man's knowledge, because I have so much of it.\tIf He Tom Sawyer had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do and Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.\tIf man had created man, he would be ashamed of his performance.\tIf they had not landed there would be some reason for celebrating the fact.\tIf to be interesting is to be uncommonplace, it is becoming a question, with me, if there are any commonplace people.\tIf you are speaking the truth you don't have to remember anything.\tIf you can't get a compliment any other way, pay yourself one.\tIf you don't like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.\tIf you have nothing to say, say nothing.\tIf you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the principal difference between a dog and a man.\tIf you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.\tIn Boston they ask, How much does he know? In New York, How much is he worth?
