his book was published by Blaeuw.\tAristotle had said that objects fell to \"\"their natural place\"\" \u00ad i.e., to the centre of the universe: Earth.\tCopernicus died in the same year his theories were published and is believed to have received a copy of \"\"De Revolutionibus orbium coelestium\"\" on the last day of his life.\tCopernicus revolutionized astronomy and his theory had a profound effect on philosophical and religious thought.\tCopernicus said this was because they were too far away for any change to be seen.\tHe also gave a new order of the planets, in which the planets were arranged at a distance from the stationary sun in the following order: Mercury, Venus, Earth with the Moon orbiting around it, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.\tHe corrected Peuerbach's work He was influenced by Regiomontanus' work.\tHe discovered that other ancient Greeks had suggested the idea of a heliocentric universe, and this seemed better seemed even though it still needed complex mathematical  calculations to predict planetary movement.\tHe recorded his observations,  and as they were circulated so his fame as an astronomer grew.\tHe stated that the sun, not the earth, was the fixed point in the centre of the universe.\tHe then spent over three years studying law and medicine at Padua University and obtained a doctorate in Canon Law from Ferrara in 1503.\tHe was anticipated by Cusa.\tHe was doubtful about the validity of the Ptolemy's  complex Earth-centered astronomical system (on which all investigation of the heavens was based), and decided that there must be a simpler way of doing things.\tHe was influenced by the work of Al Battani.\tHis (administrative) canon's post back at the cathedral of Frombork, Poland gave him financial independence for life and in 1501 he paid a brief visit there  to confirm his appointment and secure formal leave of absence to continue his studies.\tHis biography was written by Gassendi.\tHis tables were reworked by Reinhold.\tHis work influenced Brahe, Donne, Galileo,  Gilbert, Maestlin, Scaliger, Stevin.\tIf the earth were just one more planet then it was open to scientific investigation, which conservatives considered an affront to divine authority.\tIf this were so, then the stars should move periodically move their positions very slightly.\tIn 1500 Copernicus visited Rome,  where he taught mathematics privately and made observations on a lunar eclipse which he used later for his lunar theory.\tIn 1512 he returned to Frombork and began a systematic study of the movements of planets.\tIn 1514 he circulated among his  scholarly friends a summary of his ideas in a manuscript entitled \"\"A Commentary on the Theories of the Motions of Heavenly Objects from Their Arrangements\"\".\tIn 1514 he was consulted on calendar reform by the Lateran Council,  but ducked the issue,  saying that the positions of the Sun and the Moon were not yet exactly known.\tIn 1533 Pope Clement VII gave his approval and in 1540 Copernicus reluctantly allowed Rheticus, one of his pupils, to take the manuscript to be printed at Nurnberg in Germany.\tIn Copernicus's time, while some astronomers and philosophers even welcomed his theory as a long overdue alternative to the Ptolemaic system, others were outraged at its revolutionary implications.\tIn England this was interpreted as an infinite universe with stars scattered throughout space.\tIn the 1543: \"\"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\"\", Copernicus put forward a view of the universe that provided a new basis for making the mathematical calculations needed to provide accurate information for calendar reform, to predict astronomical events like eclipses,  and to investigate the cosmos.\tOsiander added a preface to the work in which he stated that Copernicus's model of the heavens only provided a working model for the simplification of astronomical mathematics and did not claim to represent what was really going on in the sky.\tOver the next twenty years Copernicus developed his ideas, backing them up with mathematical calculations and diagrams.\tPope  Alexander VI gave him professorship His system was opposed by Bellarmine.\tScientific circles were more receptive to Copernican theory and at the beginning of the seventeenth century the Ptolemaic theory was first formally abandoned by Kepler.\tThe Copernican system offered scientists a less clumsy method than that of Ptolemy for calculating planetary movement but it did mean they had to make two major changes in their mind-set.\tThe earth was not fixed: it rotated daily round its own axis and made an annual revolution around the sun.\tThe first arose from the concept of the Earth orbiting round the Sun.\tThe problem was that they had been seen not to do so at all.\tThe second change challenged Aristotle by upsetting his doctrine on gravity.\tThis eventually led to Newton's laws of gravity.\tThis meant that the universe was much bigger than had been supposed.\tThis was in order to reduce the dangerous hostility to any ideas that contradicted Aristotle who had claimed that the Earth was the fixed central point in the universe.\tTo consider that the Earth was not the centre of a universe was seen by Rome as questioning the god-given order of the universe and threatening man's special relationship with God.\tWhen Protestant reformers including Luther and Melanchthon opposed publication, Rheticus took the manuscript to Leipzig where the Humanist scholar Osiander oversaw publication.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence",
