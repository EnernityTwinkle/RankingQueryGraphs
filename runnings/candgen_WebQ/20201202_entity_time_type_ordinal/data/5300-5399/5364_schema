Hostility to the mother in our societies is an index of mental health.\tAn ounce of mother is worth a pound of clergy.\tAnyone who doesn't miss the past never had a mother.\tAs her sons have seen her: the mother in patriarchy: controlling, erotic, castrating, heart-suffering, guilt-ridden, and guilt-provoking; a marble brow, a huge breast, an avid cave; between her legs snakes, swamp-grass, or teeth; on her lap a helpless infant or a martyred son. She exists for one purpose: to bear and nourish the son.\tBut the mother's yearning, that completest type of the life in another life which is the essence of real human love, feels the presence of the cherished child even in the debased, degraded man.\tEvery man must define his identity against his mother. If he does not, he just falls back into her and is swallowed up.\tFew misfortunes can befall a boy which bring worse consequences than to have a really affectionate mother.\tFor that's what a woman, a mother wants -- to teach her children to take an interest in life. She knows it's safer for them to be interested in other people's happiness than to believe in their own.\tGod couldn't be everywhere, so he created mothers\tHe that would the daughter win must with the mother first begin.\tHow simple a thing it seems to me that to know ourselves as we are, we must know our mothers names.\tI believe that always, or almost always, in all childhood and in all the lives that follow them, the mother represents madness. Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we've ever met.\tLet France have good mothers, and she will have good sons.\tLord Illingworth: All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. Mrs. Allonby: No man does. That is his.\tMen never think, at least seldom think, what a hard task it is for us women to go through this very often. God's will be done, and if He decrees that we are to have a great number of children why we must try to bring them up as useful and exemplary members of society.\tMorality and its victim, the mother -- what a terrible picture! Is there indeed anything more terrible, more criminal, than our glorified sacred function of motherhood?\tMotherhood is the strangest thing, it can be like being one's own Trojan horse.\tMothers are the most instinctive philosophers.\tMy mother had a great deal of trouble with me, but I think she enjoyed it.\tMy mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother. I attribute all my success in life to the moral, intellectual and physical education I received from her.\tNo culture on earth outside of mid-century suburban America has ever deployed one woman per child without simultaneously assigning her such major productive activities as weaving, farming, gathering, temple maintenance, and tent-building. The reason is that full-time, one-on-one child-raising is not good for women or children.\tNobody can misunderstand a boy like his own mother. Mothers at present can bring children into the world, but this performance is apt to mark the end of their capacities. They can't even attend to the elementary animal requirements of their offspring. It is quite surprising how many children survive in spite of their mothers.\tOnly in America do these peasants, our mothers, get their hair dyed platinum at the age of sixty, and walk up and down Collins Avenue in Florida in pedal pushers and mink stoles -- and with opinions on every subject under the sun. It isn't their fault they were given a gift like speech -- look, if cows could talk, they would say things just as idiotic.\tSome are kissing mothers and some are scolding mothers, but it is love just the same -- and most mothers kiss and scold together.\tTake motherhood: nobody ever thought of putting it on a moral pedestal until some brash feminists pointed out, about a century ago, that the pay is lousy and the career ladder nonexistent.\tThe Enemy, who wears her mother's usual face and confidential tone, has access; doubtless stares into her writing case and listens on the phone.\tThe fact that we are all trained to be mothers from infancy on means that we are all trained to devote our lives to men, whether they are our sons or not; that we are all trained to force other women to exemplify the lack of qualities which characterizes the cultural construct of femininity.\tThe kind of power mothers have is enormous. Take the skyline of Istanbul -- enormous breasts, pathetic little willies, a final revenge on Islam. I was so scared I had to crouch in the bottom of the boat when I saw it.\tThe mother's heart is the child's schoolroom.\tThe worker can unionize, go out on strike; mothers are divided from each other in homes, tied to their children by compassionate bonds; our wildcat strikes have most often taken the form of physical or mental breakdown.\tThere are lots of things that you can brush under the carpet about yourself until you're faced with somebody whose needs won't be put off.\tThere was never a great man who had not a great mother.\tWhat do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?\tWhatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not.\tWhere there is a mother in the home, matters go well.\tWomen know the way to rear up children (to be just). They know a simple, merry, tender knack of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes, and stringing pretty words that make no sense.
