Thomson, the discoverer of the electron, would appreciate his doctoral thesis, which he had painstakingly translated into English.\tBohr stated that though it is true that quantum mechanics and relativity are essential to an understanding of phenomena on the atomic scale, any conclusion drawn from these principles must not conflict with the way the everyday world behaved.\tBohr theorized that the nucleus could be likened to a liquid droplet, and that the forces that pull together, or  attract, protons and neutrons, could be compared to the forces that operate between the molecules that make up the droplet, which was constantly oscillating and changing shape in response to its internal forces.\tBohr worked at Manchester from 1914 to 1916, but returned to the University of Copenhagen, where a chair of theoretical physics had been created especially for him.\tBut Rutherford was totally on Bohr's side and considered him a genius.\tBut in September, 1943, after receiving news that his own life was in danger, he and his family were spirited to Sweden by the Danish resistance movement.\tBut it was unclear how those particles were arranged within the nucleus, and how the nucleus was shaped.\tBut many physicists were not persuaded.\tBy 1934, it had been established that the nucleus consisted of two kinds of particles,  protons and neutrons.\tDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Bohr wrote extensively about atomic structures, proposing two concepts that he considered fundamental to the \"\"new physics\"\".\tDuring the 30s, Bohr turned to a new, but related, topic: the composition of the atomic nucleus.\tFor a few months, Bohr and his son Aage helped in a British project to make a nuclear fission bomb, then moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with a British research team, to work on the Manhattan Project, whose aim was to build the world's first atomic bomb.\tFor more than a century, it had been known that light from the heating of an element produced characteristics line in the spectrum of the light seen through a prism.\tHe attended the funeral of  philologist Jespersen.\tHe influenced Kastler.\tHe offered Bohr a job as lecturer in physics at Manchester.\tHe retired as professor of physics from the University of Copenhagen in 1955, but continued to serve as director of the Institute until his death in Copenhagen in 1962.\tHe served as its director for the next 40 years.\tHe was appalled to discover that Thomson had lost interest in the subject and failed to realize the importance of Bohr's thesis.\tHis quantum mechanical model of the atom was the key step in scientific understanding of atomic structure.\tHis work related to that of  Fermi, Born and Dirac.\tImmediately after getting his doctorate, Bohr travelled to England to continue his research in electron theory at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University.\tIn 1922, the brilliant success of his work on atomic structure earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.\tIn 1944, Bohr tried to persuade British prime minister Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the need for international cooperation in establishing a free exchange of people and ideas so that nuclear weapons could be controlled.\tIn early 1912, moved to Manchester to spend three months working on Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom.\tRutherford had discovered the atomic nucleus in 1911 from his work on alpha rays.\tSoon after, Bohr met British physicist Rutherford, then at the University of Manchester.\tThe Copenhagen Institute rapidly became a center for theoretical physicists throughout the world, and such figures as Pauli, Gamow and Heisenberg developed Bohr's work there, resulting in the theories of quantum and wave mechanics that more fully explain the behavior of electrons within atoms.\tThe best example was the wave-particle duality discovered in the 1930s, in which particles were found to have wavelike characteristics,  and waves to have particle-like properties.\tThe first was the principle of \"\"complementarity\"\" that stated there may be more than one true and accurate way to view natural phenomena.\tThe liquid-drop model was vindicated when Bohr correctly predicted that the differing behavior of the nuclei of uranium-235 and uranium-238 was due to the fact that the number of neutrons in each nucleus was odd and even respectively.\tThe most famous and most outspoken anti-Bohr, however, was German/American physicist Einstein, who never accepted Bohr's claim that quantum mechanics was the \"\"rational generalization of classical physics\"\", necessary for the understanding of atomic phenomena.\tThe most important aspect of the Bohr liquid-drop model was its later ability to explain the process of nuclear fission (the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two parts, almost equal in mass, following the absorption of a neutron, with the release of a tremendous amount of nuclear energy), discovered in 1938 by Otto Hahn,  Fritz Strassmann and Lise Meitner.\tThe second concept, the principle of \"\"correspondence\"\", suggested that the laws of classical physics could be preserved in light of the new quantum physics.\tThe specific pattern of the lines was unique for each element.\tThey argued that it was completely at odds with classical physics, and Bohr's use of a classical model to explain the structure and behavior of the nucleus, made the theory even more illogical.\tTo confront this problem, Bohr began with the question of atomic spectra.\tWithin a few years, he helped plan the University of Copenhagen's new Institute for Theoretical Physics, which opened in 1921.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.059y0", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
