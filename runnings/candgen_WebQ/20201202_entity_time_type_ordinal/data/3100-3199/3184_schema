I admit the deed! - tear up the planks! here, here! - It is the beating of his hideous heart!\"\"\tA strong argument for the religion of Christ is this -- that offences against Charity are about the only ones which men on their death-beds can be made -- not to understand -- but to feel -- as crime.\tA wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\tAfter reading all that has been written, and after thinking all that can be thought, on the topics of God and the soul, the man who has a right to say that he thinks at all, will find himself face to face with the conclusion that, on these topics, the most profound thought is that which can be the least easily distinguished from the most superficial sentiment.\tAll that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream.\tBeauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem.\tBeauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears.\tBelieve me, there exists no such dilemma as that in which a gentleman is placed when he is forced to reply to a blackguard.\tBetween ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous.\tBut as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to-day, or the agonies which are have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.\tDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.\tI became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.\tI have great faith in fools; My friends call it self-confidence.\tI have many occasional dealings with Adversity -- but the want of parental affection has been the heaviest of my trials.\tI have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active --not more happy --nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.\tI never can hear a crowd of people singing and gesticulating, all together, at an Italian opera, without fancying myself at Athens, listening to that particular tragedy, by Sophocles, in which he introduces a full chorus of turkeys, who set about bewailing the death of Meleager.\tI wish I could write as mysterious as a cat.\tI would define, in brief, the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation of Beauty.\tIf any ambitious man have a fancy to revolutionize, at one effort, the universal world of human thought, human opinion, and human sentiment...\tIf in many of my productions terror has been the thesis, I maintain that terror is not of Germany but of the soul.\tIf you wish to forget anything on the spot, make a note that this thing is to be remembered.\tIn criticism I will be bold, and as sternly, absolutely just with friend and foe. From this purpose nothing shall turn me.\tIt may be roundly asserted that human ingenuity cannot concoct a cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.\tIt may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma... which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.\tIt will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\tMan's real life is happy, chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so.\tMost writers -- poets in especial -- prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy -- an ecstatic intuition -- and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes...\tMournful and Never-ending Remembrance.\tNever to suffer would never to have been blessed.\tOf puns it has been said that those who most dislike them are those who are least able to utter them.\tOurs is a world of words: Quiet we call \"\"Silence\"\" \u2013 which is the merest word of all.\tQuoth the raven, \"\"Nevermore!\"\"\tThank Heaven! the crisis --The danger, is past, and the lingering illness, is over at last --, and the fever called Living is conquered at last.\tThat man is not truly brave who is afraid either to seem or to be, when it suits him, a coward.\tThat pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating and the most intense, is derived, I maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful.\tThe analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis.\tThe best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind.\tThe boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?\tThe death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.\tThe ninety and nine are with dreams, content but the hope of the world made new, is the hundredth man who is grimly bent on making those dreams come true.\tThe nose of a mob is its imagination. By this, at any time, it can be quietly led.\tThe writer who neglects punctuation, or mispunctuates, is liable to be misunderstood for the want of merely a comma, it often occurs that an axiom appears a paradox, or that a sarcasm is converted into a sermonoid.\tThere are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made.\tThere are few cases in which mere popularity should be considered a proper test of merit; but the case of song-writing is, I think, one of the few.\tThere are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell.\tThere is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.\tThey who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity; and thrill; in waking; to find they have been upon the verge of the great secret.\tTo be thoroughly conversant with a man's heart, is to take our final lesson in the iron-clasped volume of despair.\tTo observe attentively is to remember distinctly.\tTo vilify a great man is the readiest way in which a little man can himself attain greatness.\tWe now demand the light artillery of the intellect; we need the curt, the condensed, the pointed, the readily diffused -- in place of the verbose, the detailed, the voluminous, the inaccessible. On the other hand, the lightness of the artillery should not degenerate into pop-gunnery -- by which term we may designate the character of the greater portion of the newspaper press -- their sole legitimate object being the discussion of ephemeral matters in an ephemeral manner.\tWere I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul. The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of Artist.\tWith me poetry has not been a purpose, but a passion.\tYet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heartone of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.02lt8", ["people.person.quotations"]]]}
