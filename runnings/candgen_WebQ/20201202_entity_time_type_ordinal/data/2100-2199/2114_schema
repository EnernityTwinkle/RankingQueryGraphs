While he was making instruments for Professor Black, he learned about Black's his discovery of latent heat.\tHis company had become involved in the development of the engine, when other ironworks had been incapable of boring out the engine cylinder with the required precision.\tHis name was given to the watt, the unit of electrical power.\tHis work related to that of  Trevithick, Smeaton, Savery, Rennie, Jefferson, Smithson and Neilson.\tIn 1754, Watt went to Glasgow where a member of his mother's family helped him find temporary work as an optician's assistant, but he soon found that no training was available in Glasgow and left for London.\tIn 1757, Adam Smith arranged for Watt to be allowed to set up an instrument making shop within the University precincts.\tIn 1763, Professor John Anderson asked him to repair a model of the Newcomen pump and, while he was working on it, he found that the pump performed erratically and had heavy fuel consumption.\tIn 1783, Watt determined the use of horsepower as a system of measuring power, to provide a systematic means of pricing machinery.\tIn 1783, Watt hit on the idea that water was a compound rather than an element, so he submitted a paper to the Royal Society.\tIn 1784 Watt was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh and, the next year, became a Fellow of the Royal Society in London.\tIn the year Watt had patented his improved engine, Arkwright designed a machine for spinning with rollers.\tIn this way the main cylinder was kept hot enough not to cause premature condensation on each cycle, when new steam entered.\tLater this was further developed by the American Cyrus P. Dalkin, and was in use until the development of the photocopier.\tMade the engines for the SS Great Eastern.\tMany Glasgow scientists came to examine the instruments while the work was being done and were impressed with the standard of Watt's work.\tOn the way back, he stopped off in Birmingham and met Boulton, an industrialist friend of Roebuck.\tOne of the first orders for Watt's copying machines, patented in 1780, came from Adam Smith.\tOne of these was to make the engine double acting, so that it operated on the return of the piston as well as on the forward motion.\tOther members and acquaintances included Erasmus Darwin, Wedgwood and the eminent chemists, Lavoisier and Berthollet.\tRoebuck's business collapsed in 1774, so Watt went into partnership with Boulton, with a plan to build a new steam engine at Boulton's Soho Foundry in Birmingham.\tThanks to what he had learned from Black about latent heat, he was able to design a system to keep the pump cylinder hot, while sending the spent steam to evaporate in a separate condenser kept under chilled water.\tThe Argand lamp lit Watt's factory.\tThe engineer Clegg was his apprentice Involved in the development of gaslight.\tThe improved steam engine of James Watt is the cornerstone on which the modern technological world is built.\tThe outcome was that Watt was accepted as having first realised that water was a compound, but that Lavoisier had correctly determined its make-up.\tThere, John Morgan, who traded in brasswork, took him on as a fee paying, unpaid trainee and he stayed for a year, learning the trade, before going back home, ill and exhausted.\tThis caused a debate to determine who should receive the credit for discovering the composition of water, Watt,  Cavendish or Lavoisier.\tThis development played an important part in triggering the industrial revolution.\tTwo people he met and befriended in this way were the Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow University, Black and his student, John Robison.\tWatt also designed an indicator able to measure the steam pressure,  or the level of vacuum within the cylinder.\tWatt began to take a greater interest in chemistry when, through membership of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, he met Priestley.\tWatt continued to carry out various upgrades until the 1790's.\tWatt designed an automatic centrifugal governor, which reduced the supply of steam if the engine was going too fast,  and increased it when the engine slowed.\tWatt's employee, Murdock developed a 'sun-and-planet' gear that enabled rotary motion.\tWatt's most famous invention happened during the time he was working at the university.\tWhen the new engine was nearly ready, the company received two orders, one from the ironworks of John Wilkinson.\tWith help from Roebuck, a friend of Joseph Black, Watt spent a great deal of time experimenting with the objective of building a full size engine.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.043rm", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
