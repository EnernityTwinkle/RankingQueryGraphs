he suffered losses at Brandywine and Germantown.\tAfter 1769, Washington became a leader of Virginia's opposition to Great Britain's colonial policies.\tAfter a series of errors of judgement, Braddock was ambushed by the French and their Indian allies on the Monongahela River.\tAfter holding his bedraggled and dispirited army together during the difficult winter (1777-78) at Valley Forge, Washington learned that France had recognized American independence.\tAfter several hours of fierce fighting, on 3 July Washington was forced to surrender when driving rain flooded the fort and ruined his ammunition.\tAfter the war, Washington returned to Mount Vernon, which had declined in his absence.\tAlthough Washington reluctantly accepted command of the army in 1798 when war with France seemed imminent, he did not assume an active role, preferring to spend his last years in retirement at Mount Vernon.\tAlthough he received public recognition and many awards and honors - including, in 1781, along with the English philosopher and supporter of the American Revolution Price, an honorary degree from Yale - he at first avoided involvement in Virginia politics.\tAlthough he was a good administrator, he failed to heal the breach between factions led by Jefferson (Democratic-Republicans) and Hamilton (Federalists), and because he supported many of Hamilton's controversial fiscal policies - including the assumption of state debts, the Bank of the United States, and the excise tax  -  during the early 1790s Washington became the target of vicious personal attacks by Jefferson's supporters.\tAlthough the campaigns here were conducted by other generals, Washington remained responsible for the overall direction of the war.\tAndrew Jackson voted against tributes on his retirement.\tAs a result, in 1755, at the age of 23, he was promoted to colonel and appointed commander-in-chief of the Virginia militia, with responsibility for defending the frontier.\tAs full-scale war between Britain and France became inevitable, Washington was eager to participate, but when he learned that the British government had ordered that colonials could hold a rank no higher than captain, he resigned his commission at the end of 1754.\tBy 1753 the growing rivalry between the British and French over control of the Ohio Valley, soon to erupt into the French and Indian War (1754-63), created new opportunities for the ambitious young Washington, and in October 1753 he was dispatched by Dinwiddie on a fruitless mission to warn the French commander at Fort Le Boeuf against further encroachment on territory claimed by Britain.\tBy March 1797, when Washington left office, the country's financial system was well established, the American Indian threat east of the Mississippi had been largely eliminated, and both Jay's and Pinckney's Treaty (1795) with Spain had enlarged U.S. territory and removed serious diplomatic difficulties.\tCommander-in-chief of American forces during the American Revolution, chairman of the Convention that wrote the United States Constitution, and first President of the United States, he led the movement which turned America from an English colony into a self-governing nation.\tDuring his first term of office, Washington generally acted carefully and deliberately as President (as he had as military commander), aware of the need to build an firm foundation and executive structure that could accommodate future governments and presidents.\tDuring this month-long expedition, Washington began to appreciate the uses and value of land, and on his return studied surveying and became licensed by the College of William and Mary.\tEarly in March 1776, using cannon brought down from Ticonderoga by Henry Knox, Washington occupied Dorchester Heights, effectively commanding the city and forcing the British to evacuate.\tEndowed Washington College.\tFighting broke out in spring 1775, and in June Washington was unanimously appointed as commander-in-chief of the rebel forces besieging British-occupied Boston.\tFriend of politician Gouverneur Morris.\tGeorge Washington was born in 1732 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, the eldest son of Augustine Washington and his second wife, Mary Ball, who were prosperous Virginia gentry of English descent.\tHe ordered Paine's pamphlet to be read to the troops at Valley Forge.\tHe then moved to defend New York City against the combined land and sea forces of Sir William Howe, but eventually retreated from Manhattan through New Jersey into Pennsylvania.\tHe took the oath administered by Livingston on 30th April 1789 in New York City, at the age of 57.\tHe was succeeded by his vice-president, Federalist John Quincy Adams.\tHis acceptance of Jay's Treaty (1795), which settled outstanding differences between the United States and Britain (but which Democratic- Republicans viewed as a surrender to British demands), revived attacks on the President.\tHis early education included the study of mathematics, the classics, and \"\"rules of civility.\"\" When his father died in 1743, Washington became a ward of his half-brother Lawrence, and went to Mount Vernon to live on his plantation on the Potomac.\tHis ideals of liberty and democracy set a standard for future presidents and for the whole country.\tHis presence together with Franklin lent prestige to the proceedings, and although he made few direct contributions he generally supported the move for a strong constitutional government.\tIn 1748 Washington was taken on a surveying expedition by George William Fairfax in the Shenandoah Valley wilderness.\tIn 1749 he was appointed Culpeper County surveyor, and helped lay out the Virginia town of Belhaven (now Alexandria).\tIn 1751, Washington accompanied Lawrence to Barbados in an effort to cure his tuberculosis.\tIn 1774-75, Washington acted as a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congress where he joined ranks with such revolutionaries as Samuel Adams.\tIn 1780 the main theater of the war shifted to the South, where Britain held Georgia and much of the Carolinas.\tIn 1789, after the new Constitution was submitted to the states for ratification, he was unanimously elected President and agreed to serve.\tIn January 1759, he married Martha Dandridge Custis, a wealthy young widow with two small children and the same year, with the support of an ever-growing circle of influential friends, he entered politics, serving (1759-74) in Virginia's House of Burgesses (the colonial assembly), and also as a county justice and vestryman in his parish.\tIn June 1778 he attacked the British near Monmouth Courthouse, N.J., as they were withdrawing from Philadelphia to New York, and Washington's quick action on the field prevented an American defeat.\tIn May 1787, however, Washington headed the Virginia delegation to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was unanimously elected presiding officer.\tIn mid- December 1799, Washington contracted what was probably quinsy or acute laryngitis, and died after a brief illness.\tIn spite of the animosities and conflicting opinions between Democratic- Republicans (which included future fifth president Monroe) and members of the Hamiltonian Federalist party, the two groups were at least united in accepting the new Federal government.\tLawrence failed to recover and died on his return home in 1752.\tMeanwhile, the major success of that year, the defeat in October 1777 of the British at Saratoga, had belonged not to Washington but to Benedict Arnold and General Horatio Gates.\tMeanwhile, with Lawrence's death Virginia's colonial governor Robert Dinwiddie appointed Washington adjutant commander of one of Virginia's four militia districts with the rank of major.\tNoah Webster was a supporter.\tOn 28 May 1754 he met a small French and Indian party, and in the resulting skirmish the French commander, Joseph Coulon, sieur de Jumonville, was killed and most of his men captured.\tOn his arrival Washington learned that the French, numbering more than a thousand, had captured the fort (which they named Fort Duquesne).\tOn taking office, Washington was immediately faced with filling almost a thousand offices, the most important going to Jay (chief justice), Jefferson (Secretary of State), Alexander Hamilton (Secretary of the Treasury), Henry Knox (Secretary of War), Edmund Randolph (attorney general), and Samuel Osgood (postmaster general).\tRobert E. Lee married his adopted son's daughter.\tSoon afterwards Washington leased the Mount Vernon estate from Lawrence's widow, and by 1761 had acquired the property outright.\tThe French agreed to lenient terms, allowing Washington to march his remaining troops back to Williamsburg.\tThe French party had in fact been charged with issuing a peaceful warning, and the French were outraged, calling the killing an \"\"assassination\"\", and sending a party of 1200 to attack Fort Necessity.\tThe contrast between Washington's record and Gates's brilliant victory was one factor that led to the so-called \"\"Conway Cabal\"\" - an intrigue by some members of Congress and army officers to replace Washington with a more successful commander, probably Gates.\tThe following year, however, he joined British general Edward Braddock's expedition against the French as a volunteer.\tWashington acted quickly, and the plan eventually collapsed due to the lack of public support and Washington's overall superiority to his rivals.\tWashington built a small fort he named Fort Necessity, about forty miles away at Great Meadows, Pennsylvania, and marched to intercept any French troops.\tWashington left the army in 1758 and returned to Mount Vernon.\tWashington refused to run for a third term and, after a masterly Farewell Address in which he warned the United States against \"\"the baneful effects\"\" of party politics and against permanent alliances abroad, he went home to Mount Vernon.\tWashington spent his early years on the family estate on Pope's Creek along the Potomac River, and attended school irregularly from the ages of seven to fourteen, first with the local church sexton and later with a local schoolmaster.\tWashington was re-elected president in 1792, and the following year a major crisis occurred in his cabinet over the issue of American neutrality during the war between England and France.\tWashington's diary account of the dangers and difficulties of his journey was published at the colonial capital of Williamsburg on his return in early 1754, and helped to win him promotion to lieutenant colonel.\tWashington's fearless conduct in battle, and his dramatic descriptions of these engagements - written to a younger brother, but subsequently published all over America - made him a hero of English-speaking America.\tWashington, although seriously ill, managed to lead the survivors to safety, again enhancing his military reputation.\tWashington, whose policy of neutrality angered the pro-French Jeffersonians, was horrified by the excesses of the French Revolution and enraged by the tactics of Edmond Genet, the French minister in the United States, which amounted to foreign interference in American politics.\tWith an eye to developing closer commercial ties with the British, the president agreed with the Hamiltonians on the need for peace with Great Britain.\tWith the aid of the Prussian Baron von Steuben and the Frenchman LaFayette, he concentrated on turning the army into a fighting force, and by spring 1778 he was ready to take the field again.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.034rd", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.

It abounds all over the western country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development has scarcely commenced. Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon our shores hundred of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe. I intend to point them to the gold and silver that waits for them in the West.

That is all.\tI never had a policy; I have just tried to do my very best each and every day.\tI see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. Corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong it's reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.\tI take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I dont believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good.\tI think very much of the people, as an old friend said he thought of woman. He said when he lost his first wife, who had been a great help to him in his business, he thought he was ruinedthat he could never find another to fill her place. At length, however, he married another, who he found did quite as well as the first, and that his opinion now was that any woman would do well who was well done by. So I think of the whole people of this nationthey will ever do well if well done by. We will try to do well by them in all parts of the country, North and South, with entire confidence that all will be well with all of us.\tI walk slowly, but I never walk backward.\tI want it said of me by those who knew me best, that I always plucked a thistle and planted a flower where I thought a flower would grow.\tI will prepare and some day my chance will come.\tI will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races,that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.\tI'm a slow walker, but I never walk back.\tIf I care to listen to every criticism, let alone act on them, then this shop may as well be closed for all other businesses.

If the end brings me out wrong, then ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.\tIf the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the people will have ceased, to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there, in this view, any assault upon the court, or the judges. It is a duty, from which they may not shrink, to decide cases properly brought before them; and it is no fault of theirs, if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\tIf this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.\tIf we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how to do it.\tIf you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem.

He is elected by them, as well as congress is. But can he, in the nature [of] things, know the wants of the people, as well as three hundred other men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a congress?\tIn giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.\tIn the early days of the world, the Almighty said to the first of our race In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread; and since then, if we except the light and the air of heaven, no good thing has been, or can be enjoyed by us, without having first cost labour. And inasmuch [as] most good things are produced by labour, it follows that [all] such things of right belong to those whose labour has produced them. But it has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have labored, and others have, without labour, enjoyed a large proportion of the fruits. This is wrong, and should not continue. To [secure] to each labourer the whole product of his labour, or as nearly as possible, is a most worthy object of any good government.\tIn this and like communities, public sentiment is everything.

You have done the labor; maintain itkeep it. If men choose to serve you, go with them; but as you have made up your organization upon principle, stand by it; for, as surely as God reigns over you, and has inspired your mind, and given you a sense of propriety, and continues to give you hope, so surely will you still cling to these ideas, and you will at last come back after your wanderings, merely to do your work over again.\tIt is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.\tIt is my ambition and desire to so administer the affairs of the government while I remain President that if at the end I have lost every other friend on earth I shall at least have one friend remaining and that one shall be down inside me.\tIt is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: And this, too, shall pass away. How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!how consoling in the depth of affliction!\tIt is the eternal struggle between these two principles -- right and wrong. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time and will ever continue to struggle. It is the same spirit that says, You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it.\tLabor is prior to, and independent of, capital.

These began in England in 1624; and, in this country, with the adoption of our constitution. Before then [these?], any man might instantly use what another had invented; so that the inventor had no special advantage from his own invention. The patent system changed this; secured to the inventor, for a limited time, the exclusive use of his invention; and thereby added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production of new and useful things.\tNo man has a good enough memory to make a successful liar.\tNo man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.\tNo matter how much the cats fight, there always seem to be plenty of kittens.\tNothing valuable can be lost by taking time.\tOur cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted by, its own undoubted friendsthose whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the workwho do care for the result. Two years ago the Republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external circumstance against us. Of strange, discordant, and even, hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the battle through, under the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and pampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now?now when that same enemy is wavering, dissevered, and belligerent? The result is not doubtful. We shall not failif we stand firm, we shall not fail. Wise councils may accelerate or mistakes delay it, but, sooner or later, the victory is sure to come.\tPeople who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.\tPlainly, the central idea of secession, is the essence of anarchy.\tProhibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes crimes out of things that are not crimes.\tProhibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes. A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.\tProperty is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; it is a positive good in the world.\tProperty is the fruit of laborproperty is desirableis a positive good in the world. That some should be rich, shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprize.

No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.\tSenator [Stephen] Douglas is of world-wide renown. All the anxious politicians of his party, or who have been of his party for years past, have been looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the President of the United States. They have seen in his round, jolly, fruitful face, postoffices, landoffices, marshalships, and cabinet appointments, chargeships and foreign missions, bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands.\tSeriously, I do not think I fit for the presidency.\tSingular indeed that the people should be writhing under oppression and injury, and yet not one among them to be found, to raise the voice of complaint.\tSlavery is founded on the selfishness of man's nature -- opposition to it on his love of justice.

In all that the people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere. The desirable things which the individuals of a people can not do, or can not well do, for themselves, fall into two classes: those which have relation to wrongs, and those which have not. Each of these branch off into an infinite variety of subdivisions. The firstthat in relation to wrongsembraces all crimes, misdemeanors, and nonperformance of contracts. The other embraces all which, in its nature, and without wrong, requires combined action, as public roads and highways, public schools, charities, pauperism, orphanage, estates of the deceased, and the machinery of government itself. From this it appears that if all men were just, there still would be some, though not so much, need for government.\tThe most notable feature of a disturbance in your city last summer, was the hanging of some working people by other working people. It should never be so.

There are few things wholly evil, or wholly good. Almost every thing, especially of governmental policy, is an inseparable compound of the two; so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded.\tThe way for a young man to rise is to improve himself in every way he can, never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him.\tThe world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing. With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other mens labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatable things, called by the same nameliberty. And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatable namesliberty and tyranny.\tThere are few things wholly evil or wholly good. Almost everything, especially of government policy, is an inseparable compound of the two, so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded.\tThere is an important sense in which government is distinctive from administration.

For it has been said, all that a man hath will he give for his life; and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his countrys cause. The highest merit, then, is due to the soldier.\tThis is a world of compensation; and he who would be no slave must consent to have no slave. Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God, cannot long retain it.\tThose arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow. What are these arguments? They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world. You will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the people, not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden. That is their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old serpent that says you work and I eat, you toil and I will enjoy the fruits of it. Turn in whatever way you willwhether it comes from the mouth of a King, an excuse for enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the same old serpent, and I hold if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this, should be granted, it does not stop with the negro.\tThose who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves.\tThose who write clearly have readers, those who write obscurely have commentators.\tThough passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.\tTo correct the evils, great and small, which spring from want of sympathy and from positive enmity among strangers, as nations or as individuals, is one of the highest functions of civilization.\tTo give the victory to the right, not bloody bullets, but peaceful ballots only, are necessary.\tTo sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.\tTowering genius disdains a beaten path.\tUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people may be engaged in. That everyone may receive at least a moderate education appears to be an objective of vital importance.\tWanting to work is so rare a merit that it should be encouraged.\tWe cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\tWe have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth and power, as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us!\tWe know nothing of what will happen in future, but by the analogy of experience.\tWe meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart.\tWe must ask where we are and whither we are tending.\tWe must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot.\tWe should be too big to take offense and too noble to give it.\tWhat I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.\tWhat constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence? It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, the guns of our war steamers, or the strength of our gallant and disciplined army. These are not our reliance against a resumption of tyranny in our fair land. All of them may be turned against our liberties, without making us stronger or weaker for the struggle. Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in our bosoms. Our defense is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands, every where. Destroy this spirit, and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors.\tWhat has once happened, will invariably happen again, when the same circumstances which combined to produce it, shall again combine in the same way.\tWhat is conservatism?

A man in the crowd asked him how he liked it. His reply was that if it was not for the honor of the thing, he would much rather walk.\tYou may burn my body to ashes, and scatter them to the winds of heaven; you may drag my soul down to the regions of darkness and despair to be tormented forever; but you will never get me to support a measure which I believe to be wrong, although by doing so I may accomplish that which I believe to be right.\tYou may fool all the people some of the time, you can even fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all the time.\tYou may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you cant fool all of the people all the time.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0gzh", ["people.person.quotations"]]]}
