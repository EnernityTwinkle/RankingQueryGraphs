And what are you reading, Miss -- -? Oh! it is only a novel! replies the young lady; while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda ; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humor, are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language.\tAn engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged; no harm can be done.\tBusiness, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.\tEvery man is surrounded by a neighborhood of voluntary spies.\tFor what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?\tFrom politics it was an easy step to silence.\tHappiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.\tHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.\tI am afraid that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety.\tIn nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels.\tIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man is in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\tIt is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.\tIt is indolence... Indolence and love of ease; a want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish; read the newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine.\tIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind; but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\tIt will, I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation.\tLet other pens dwell on guilt and misery.\tNobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\tOne cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\tOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering.\tOne half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\tOne has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound.\tSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken.\tSingle women have a dreadful propensity for being poor. Which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony.\tSurprises are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable.\tThere are certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are of pretty woman to deserve them.\tThere is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.\tThere is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.\tThose who do not complain are never pitied.\tTo look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain for the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive.\tTo sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment.\tWe do not look in our great cities for our best morality.\tWhat dreadful hot weather we have! It keeps me in a continual state of inelegance.\tWhere an opinion is general, it is usually correct.\tWhy not seize the pleasure at once? How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation.\tWith men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every feature works.\tYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends.

she produced her most engaging character, the intelligent and high-spirited Elizabeth Bennet.\tAs a child and young woman she read widely - enjoying in particular the works of  Fanny Burney and Sir Walter Scott,  both of whom she met - and enjoyed occasional visits to Bath, London,  Lyme, and her brothers' houses.\tAusten remained at Chawton for the last eight years of her life and entered her second great phase of almost non-stop creativity (1810-17).\tBy the age of 14 she was producing parodies of a variety of 18th-century literary forms, from sentimental novels to Oliver Goldsmith's 'History of England'.\tDuring the first of these periods (1795-98), she wrote the novel-in-letters 'Elinor and Marianne' (1795-96) and then 'First Impressions' (1796-97), which became the first version of 'Pride and Prejudice',  and which her father submitted to the London publisher Cadell but was refused.\tFinally, in 1809, with the help of her brother Edward, Austen and her mother and sister were able to return to Hampshire, to a cottage in Chawton, a village near Steventon.\tFor the following eight years, the family lived in a succession of temporary lodgings or visited relatives at Bath, London, Clifton (Warwickshire) and, finally - with the death of her father in 1805 - Southampton (1805-09).\tGenerally regarded as her greatest achievement, 'Emma' is the work which most fully realized Austen's own criterion of  \"\"three or four families in a country village\"\" as \"\"the very thing to work on,\"\"  and received a favourable review in March 1816 'Quarterly Review' from Sir Walter Scott, who hailed this \"\"nameless author\"\" as a masterful exponent of \"\"the modern novel\"\" in the new realist tradition.\tHer notebooks from this period (1787-94), contain plays, verses, short novels, and other prose, including 'Love and Friendship', a parody of 18th-century melodramatic fiction, and 'Lady Susan', a short novel-in-letters, written probably in 1793-94 and finally published in 1871.\tHer work influenced that of Fenimore Cooper.\tHowever, once in Winchester her condition declined rapidly, and she died (probably from Addison's Disease,  a tubercular disease of the kidneys) on 18 July (four days after the great French woman of letters, de Stael, whom she had once refused to meet), and was buried in Westminster Cathedral six days later.\tIn 1797-98 Austen then revised 'Elinor and Marianne' as an early version of 'Sense and Sensibility', and then produced the last of these early novels, 'Northanger Abbey' (written 1798-99), which successfully combines a satire on conventional novels of polite society with one on Gothic tales of terror.\tIn 1801 her father, then aged 70, retired to Bath with his wife and two daughters.\tIn 1811 Austen began 'Mansfield Park', which in its tone and subject matter (religious duty and personal morality) is her most ambitious and serious novel.\tIn April 1817 she made her will, and in the following month her sister Cassandra took her to Winchester for treatment from a surgeon at the County Hospital.\tIn August 1815 Austen began work on her last complete novel, 'Persuasion', which she finished in August 1816, the year in which a second edition of 'Mansfield Park' was published (like 'Emma', by Byron's publisher, John Murray).\tModern critics remain fascinated by the structure and organization of the novels, by the triumphs of technique that show tragedy and comedy in ordinary events and settings.\tReturning to her early works, in 1809-10 she revised 'Sense and Sensibility' for publication, and then re- created 'First Impressions' as her first major work: 'Pride and Prejudice'.\tShe then spent some time finally revising the manuscript of 'Northanger Abbey', and in January 1817 began a new novel, 'Sanditon', a satire on health resorts and invalidism, but this remained unfinished due to ill-health.\tThere followed the first of her two periods of mature composition.\tThese two novels - with the addition of the earlier 'Northanger Abbey' (eventually published posthumously in 1817) - form a distinct group in which a strong element of literary satire accompanies the comic portrayal of character and society.\tThis was published in 1814, a year after 'Pride and Prejudice' (1813) was accepted, which she followed by 'Emma' (written January 1814- March 1815, published December 1815).\tThis was sold in 1803 (probably under the title 'Susan') to the publisher Richard Crosby for \u00a310, but, although it was taken for immediate publication and was advertised, it never appeared.\tTwo years later Thomas Egerton agreed to publish 'Sense and Sensibility', which came out anonymously in November 1811, and was generally well received.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.040dv", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
