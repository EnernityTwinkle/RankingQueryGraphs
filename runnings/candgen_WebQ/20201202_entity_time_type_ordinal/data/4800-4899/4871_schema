the strait.\tDuring the winter of 1608-09 he successfully negotiated a contract with the Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch East India Company to search north of Novaya Zemlya for a northeast passage to the East.\tFinally, the ship broke free of the ice in early June, and on 12 June 1611 they began their homeward voyage, with almost no food.\tHe made several significant contributions to geographical knowledge, and his discoveries inspired the Dutch colonization of the Hudson River and English claims to much of Canada.\tHe spent the following weeks cruising unsuccessfully in search of a passage to the Pacific until the Arctic winter overtook the ship, while his crew became increasingly unhappy.\tHowever, he again found his way blocked by ice fields, and within four months he was back in England.\tHowever, he soon headed back and sailed up the coast of New Jersey to the Lower Bay of New York and, after resting off Sandy Hook for 12 days, he passed through the Narrows and sailed up the river (later named the Hudson).\tHudson reached Newfoundland early in July, and then cruised along the Atlantic  seaboard, sailing south as far as Chesapeake Bay, then turning north again and entering the Delaware River, in the hope that either of these might be an opening to the Northwest Passage.\tHudson then sailed south, following the eastern shore of the bay until in October the ship reached James Bay at the southernmost extremity.\tHudson's Bay Co named after him.\tIn April 1607 Hudson is described as in the employ of the Muscovy Company as an experienced navigator appointed to lead an expedition in search of a northeast Arctic sea passage across the North Pole to China and the 'spice islands'.\tIn April 1608, Hudson set sail on a second voyage of exploration for the Muscovy Company, this time to seek the Northeast Passage between Spitsbergen and the islands of Novaya Zemlya, which lie to the east of the Barents Sea.\tIn September Hudson was accused of distributing the food unfairly.\tNothing was ever heard of them again.\tNow an established explorer, Hudson found willing backers for his plans.\tOn 1 May 1607, Hudson set sail northwards from Gravesend in the 'Hopewell' with a crew of ten men and his son John, convinced that he would find an ice-free sea around the North Pole.\tOn 17 April 1610 Hudson sailed from London in a new ship, the 55-ton 'Discovery' with a crew of 20, first to Iceland, then sailing along the coast of Greenland to the Davis Strait, as an ice-free sea was believed to lie in the polar regions at its northern exit.\tOn 25 March 1609, Hudson sailed from Amsterdam with two ships, the 'Good Hope' and 'Half Moon', and a mixed crew of 18 Dutch and English seamen, but after successfully rounding the North Cape of Norway, the ships hit severe weather and polar ice off the coast of Novaya Zemlya, and the crew mutinied, refusing to go on.\tOn 3 August he entered the vast inland sea now known as Hudson's Bay, and thought that he had reached the Pacific.\tOn 4 October 1609 he gave up and sailed for Europe.\tOn his return voyage, he accidentally discovered Jan Mayen Island, which he named Hudson's Touches, and brought back to England information which opened up the profitable whale fisheries in Spitsbergen to the English.\tStrong tides swept his ship south round Resolution Island and, in July, westwards into Hudson Strait, an area well known to adventurers but unexplored because of its treacherous tides and ice packs.\tThe crew chose the second plan.\tThe ship reached the coast of Greenland in June but, failing to find a passage northwards through the polar ice pack, Hudson then sailed east along its edge and on 27 June he reached the Svalbard (Spitsbergen) archipelago,  where he was again stopped by the ice, and although he tried to force his way eastwards through the ice fields, his efforts proved fruitless, and on 15 September he turned and headed for home.\tThe voyage established Hudson's reputation and he soon found English patrons who prepared to finance a new expedition in search of the Northwest Passage.\tThese two failures appear to have discouraged the Muscovy Company from financing further expeditions, and Hudson was forced to look elsewhere for investors.\tTwelve days later a mutiny broke out, and Hudson, his son John, and seven others were set adrift in a small open boat, with no supplies.\tUnwilling to give up, Hudson offered them a choice between searching for an eastern passage through the Davis Strait or sailing westwards towards the Atlantic coast at around 40 degrees latitude where, according to letters and maps he had received from the Dutch cartographer Plancius and from the English soldier, explorer and colonist Captain John Smith of Virginia, there was believed to be a channel leading from the North American coast to the Pacific Ocean, and on to China.\tWhile in Holland, Hudson had heard reports of another possible channel to the Pacific across North America, said to be at about 62\u00b0 N. This channel was described in the logbooks of a voyage made in 1602 by another English explorer, Captain George Weymouth, who had described an inlet (now called Hudson Strait) where water rushed out with every ebb tide,  suggesting a body of water lying beyond the strait (and which Hudson believed to be the Pacific Ocean).\tWren was a Company Director He was supported by the Earl of Southampton.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0c065", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
