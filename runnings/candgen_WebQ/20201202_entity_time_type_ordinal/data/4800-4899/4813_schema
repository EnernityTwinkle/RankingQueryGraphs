It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\tHer voice is full of money.\tI know myself, but that is all.\tIn a real dark night of the soul it is always three o'clock in the morning, day after day.\tIt occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.\tLet me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves.

Around the same time, he made friends with Edmund Wilson, who later became a distinguished writer and critic.\tHe and Zelda went to Europe for the first time in 1921 and his collection of short stories, 'Flappers and Philosophers' came out.\tHe fell behind in his studies and in 1915, knowing that he was going to fail his exams, he left university.\tHe left the army in February 1919 and went to New York, where he took a job in an advertising agency.\tHe was a favorite of Stein.\tHe was one of the writers of  the Great American Novel.\tHis career was promoted by Mencken.\tIn 1913, he started at Princeton University.\tIn 1918, he was stationed near Montgomery, Alabama and, at a local dance, he met Zelda Sayre, the daughter of an Alabama Supreme Court judge.\tIn 1922, he published 'The Beautiful and the Damned', which has since been seen as prophetic of the Fitzgeralds' future life.\tIn 1923, he spent most of his time writing a play, 'The Vegetable', which opened in Atlantic City and failed.\tIn 1926, he published 'The Rich Boy', a short story that contains the words 'They are different from you and me', his continual statement about the rich.\tIn 1927, Fitzgerald went to Hollywood, where he met Lois Moran, who provided the inspiration for the character of Rosemary Hoyt in his next novel, 'Tender is the Night'.\tIt told the story of Anthony and Gloria Patch, a young, privileged couple living,  in expectation of a large inheritance,  in drunkenness and extravagance.\tMaking his mind up to be a successful writer, Fitzgerald gave up his advertising job and went to his parents' home where he polished his novel.\tOn his father's side, Fitzgerald was related to Key, who wrote the words of 'The Star-Spangled Banner', while his mother's family were Irish-American.\tOnce again, he revised his novel and tried hard to get some of his short stories published.\tOver the next four years, Fitzgerald split his time between America and Europe and, in 1926, some of his best short stories appeared in 'All the Sad Young Men'.\tRich was no longer a term used to describe Fitzgerald's life because, over the next decade, money dwindled, he gave up hope of a cure for Zelda's depression and his own drinking problem became worse.\tShe is a wealthy young woman called Nicole Warren, who ultimately destroys Diver.\tShe went into hospital in Switzerland until September 1931, then they returned to America.\tThe book repeats Fitzgerald's recurring theme of a poor,  aspiring young man investing his hopes in a rich, carelessly superior young woman who uses him and then leaves him.\tThe book, sometimes referred to as the Great American Novel because of its very American theme based on the ideal of unlimited dreams that are impossible to fulfil, was a critical success, but not a financial one.\tThe central character of Gatsby's dream is Daisy Buchanan, a shallow but charming young woman married to a rich man.\tThe central character, Dick Diver, is a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients.\tThe character of Jay Gatsby is a brash, self-made man from the West, who dreams of social success in the East.\tThe couple fell in love and planned to marry as soon as Fitzgerald was earning a decent living.\tThe following year, he was given another chance and when he returned to Princeton, he put all his energy into his literary studies rather than his social life.\tThe next year, badly in debt, he went to Hollywood to work as a scriptwriter and met Sheilah Graham, who became his constant companion and lover.\tThe novel captured the post-war spirit of rebellion among wealthy youngsters and it reflected the manners and morals of a new era.\tThe novel reflects Fitzgerald's own feelings about his marriage and the nature of his success.\tThe six chapters he completed show signs of a reawakened talent but, before he could finish the book, he died suddenly of a heart attack.\tThey became friendly with Hemingway who, as a young writer trying to make his way, accepted Fitzgerald's help on his unpublished novel 'The Sun Also Rises'.\tThey settled at St Raphael in the South of France and the novel was published in April 1925.\tTo pay his rising debts, he spent the next few months writing popular stories, then began his more serious work: 'The Great Gatsby' in 1924, the year they decided to move to France to save money.\tWhen America entered World War I in 1917, Fitzgerald left Princeton and joined the army as Second Lieutenant, but never served abroad.\tWhen he was two, his father's business collapsed and the family moved around, so he spent his early years in Buffalo and Syracuse, New York then, in 1908, they moved back to Minnesota.\tWhen his scriptwriting was rejected, he started to write stories for 'Esquire' then, in 1939, he began his final novel, 'The Last Tycoon'.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.02zjd", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\tHer voice is full of money.\tI know myself, but that is all.\tIn a real dark night of the soul it is always three o'clock in the morning, day after day.\tIt occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.\tLet me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand.

Around the same time, he made friends with Edmund Wilson, who later became a distinguished writer and critic.\tHe and Zelda went to Europe for the first time in 1921 and his collection of short stories, 'Flappers and Philosophers' came out.\tHe fell behind in his studies and in 1915, knowing that he was going to fail his exams, he left university.\tHe left the army in February 1919 and went to New York, where he took a job in an advertising agency.\tHe was a favorite of Stein.\tHe was one of the writers of  the Great American Novel.\tHis career was promoted by Mencken.\tIn 1913, he started at Princeton University.\tIn 1918, he was stationed near Montgomery, Alabama and, at a local dance, he met Zelda Sayre, the daughter of an Alabama Supreme Court judge.\tIn 1922, he published 'The Beautiful and the Damned', which has since been seen as prophetic of the Fitzgeralds' future life.\tIn 1923, he spent most of his time writing a play, 'The Vegetable', which opened in Atlantic City and failed.\tIn 1926, he published 'The Rich Boy', a short story that contains the words 'They are different from you and me', his continual statement about the rich.\tIn 1927, Fitzgerald went to Hollywood, where he met Lois Moran, who provided the inspiration for the character of Rosemary Hoyt in his next novel, 'Tender is the Night'.\tIt told the story of Anthony and Gloria Patch, a young, privileged couple living,  in expectation of a large inheritance,  in drunkenness and extravagance.\tMaking his mind up to be a successful writer, Fitzgerald gave up his advertising job and went to his parents' home where he polished his novel.\tOn his father's side, Fitzgerald was related to Key, who wrote the words of 'The Star-Spangled Banner', while his mother's family were Irish-American.\tOnce again, he revised his novel and tried hard to get some of his short stories published.\tOver the next four years, Fitzgerald split his time between America and Europe and, in 1926, some of his best short stories appeared in 'All the Sad Young Men'.\tRich was no longer a term used to describe Fitzgerald's life because, over the next decade, money dwindled, he gave up hope of a cure for Zelda's depression and his own drinking problem became worse.\tShe is a wealthy young woman called Nicole Warren, who ultimately destroys Diver.\tShe went into hospital in Switzerland until September 1931, then they returned to America.\tThe book repeats Fitzgerald's recurring theme of a poor,  aspiring young man investing his hopes in a rich, carelessly superior young woman who uses him and then leaves him.\tThe book, sometimes referred to as the Great American Novel because of its very American theme based on the ideal of unlimited dreams that are impossible to fulfil, was a critical success, but not a financial one.\tThe central character of Gatsby's dream is Daisy Buchanan, a shallow but charming young woman married to a rich man.\tThe central character, Dick Diver, is a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients.\tThe character of Jay Gatsby is a brash, self-made man from the West, who dreams of social success in the East.\tThe couple fell in love and planned to marry as soon as Fitzgerald was earning a decent living.\tThe following year, he was given another chance and when he returned to Princeton, he put all his energy into his literary studies rather than his social life.\tThe next year, badly in debt, he went to Hollywood to work as a scriptwriter and met Sheilah Graham, who became his constant companion and lover.\tThe novel captured the post-war spirit of rebellion among wealthy youngsters and it reflected the manners and morals of a new era.\tThe novel reflects Fitzgerald's own feelings about his marriage and the nature of his success.\tThe six chapters he completed show signs of a reawakened talent but, before he could finish the book, he died suddenly of a heart attack.\tThey became friendly with Hemingway who, as a young writer trying to make his way, accepted Fitzgerald's help on his unpublished novel 'The Sun Also Rises'.\tThey settled at St Raphael in the South of France and the novel was published in April 1925.\tTo pay his rising debts, he spent the next few months writing popular stories, then began his more serious work: 'The Great Gatsby' in 1924, the year they decided to move to France to save money.\tWhen America entered World War I in 1917, Fitzgerald left Princeton and joined the army as Second Lieutenant, but never served abroad.\tWhen he was two, his father's business collapsed and the family moved around, so he spent his early years in Buffalo and Syracuse, New York then, in 1908, they moved back to Minnesota.\tWhen his scriptwriting was rejected, he started to write stories for 'Esquire' then, in 1939, he began his final novel, 'The Last Tycoon'.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.02zjd", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
