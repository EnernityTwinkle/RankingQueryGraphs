But not while you accusingly tiptoe around the room, or perch much like a silent bird of prey on the edge of your most uncomfortable chair. (He will read them anyway, and he should read them, so let him choose his own good time.) Don't make a big exit. Just go.

It would be even tougher to marry one.\tPersonally, I can't see why it would be any less romantic to find a husband in a nice four-color catalogue than in the average downtown bar at happy hour.\tStrike an average between what a woman thinks of her husband a month before she marries him and what she thinks of him a year afterward, and you will have the truth about him.\tThe bitterest creature under heaven is the wife who discovers that her husband's bravery is only bravado, that his strength is only a uniform, that his power is but a gun in the hands of a fool.\tThe calmest husbands make the stormiest wives.\tThe husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes.\tThey are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not.\tThose men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad, who are under the discipline of shrews at home.\tThough bachelors be the strongest stakes, married men are the best binders, in the hedge of the commonwealth.\tTo catch a husband is an art; to hold him is a job.\tWhen you see what some girls marry, you realize how they must hate to work for a living.\tYou -- poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are -- I entreat to accept me as a husband.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.025t1g1", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
