ever-growing family to a small house at Mitcham, eight miles from London.\tDonne's argument that English Catholics could pledge an oath of allegiance to James I, King of England, without compromising their religious loyalty to the Pope, won him the king's favour, and earned Donne an honorary M.A. from Oxford.\tDonne's first published work, 'Pseudo- Martyr', dedicated to King James, appeared in 1610.\tDonne's next 14 years (1602-15) were marked by fruitless attempts to find work.\tDonne's style, full of elaborate metaphors and religious symbolism, his flair for drama, his wide learning and his quick wit soon established him as one of the greatest preachers of the era, and he became a favorite of both King James and the next King, Charles II.\tDuring the European trip, Donne visited the astronomer Kepler in Linz.\tDuring the years 1589-91 Donne may have travelled to Italy and Spain, but little is known of his adolescence until he was admitted as a law student in 1592 to Lincoln's Inn, where he remained for the next three years, studying hard but also enjoying the exciting literary life of London in the 1590's, attending the new plays by Shakespeare at the Globe, and beginning to write poetry.\tEgerton fired him.\tFrom November 1611 to August 1612 Donne travelled abroad with his new patron and on his return was able to move his family into a house on Drury Lane, where he remained until 1621.\tFrom this point, the king openly declared that he would promote Donne, but only if he entered the Anglican Church.\tHe continued to preach at court and at Whitehall and St. Paul's throughout the 1620s, but in 1630  fell seriously ill with stomach cancer.\tHe continued to write poetry (the  'Holy Sonnets'). n 1618-19, Donne travelled as chaplain to the Earl of Doncaster in his embassy to the German princes, writing,  before his journey,  his famous poem 'Hymn to Christ at the Author's last going into Germany', and preaching the earliest of his great sermons on death to a huge congregation at St. Paul's.\tHe had also befriended Charles Cotton (father of the writer Charles Cotton), and Jonson.\tHe wrote little more verse during his years in orders, but in 1624, after a serious illness the previous year, he published an account of his physical and spiritual suffering in the prose work, 'Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions'.\tHis poems 'The Storm' and 'The Calm' commemorate these voyages, but the expeditions cured him of any desire to experience war again.\tHowever, at York House Donne met and fell in love with Egerton's 17-year- old niece, Anne More, and in December 1601 made the fatal mistake of marrying her secretly, and against the wishes of her father.\tIn 1596 Donne left Lincoln's Inn and became one of the fashionable \"\"gentleman volunteers\"\" accompanying the Earl of Essex on a bloody military expedition against Cadiz, and then a year later with Raleigh to hunt the Spanish treasure ships off the Azores.\tIn 1601 he became a Member of Parliament for Brackley, Northants, an Egerton seat.\tIn 1611, Donne published his satire on the Jesuits, 'Ignatius his Conclave' (in which he showed his knowledge of the new astronomy of  Copernicus) and won the patronage of Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead, for whom he wrote 'A Funerall Elegie' (1610), on the death of Sir Robert's 14-year-old daughter Elizabeth.\tIn 1616 Donne was appointed to one of the most prestigious posts in London, Reader in Divinity to Lincoln's Inn.\tIn late 1612 Donne decided to take holy orders, studied for the church and wrote many of his 'Essays on Divinity'.\tIn spite of his misery during these years, Donne wrote and studied, producing prose works on theology, canon law, anti-Catholic pieces, as well as love lyrics, religious poetry (the 'Divine Poems'), and complimentary and funerary verse for his patrons.\tInfluenced poet Marvell.\tInstead, through the influence of one of his comrades-in-arms, Thomas Egerton, he became secretary to Egerton's father, Sir Thomas Egerton, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and a member of Elizabeth's Privy Council, and moved into York House on the Strand.\tJohn Donne was the first and most outstanding of the English 'metaphysical' poets and a churchman famous for his spellbinding sermons.\tLate in 1621 Donne was appointed Dean of St. Paul's, and from 1624 he was also vicar of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, where he met his first biographer (one of his parishioners) Izaak Walton.\tOn 23 January 1615 he was ordained deacon and priest by the Bishop of London.\tOn 25 February 1631 he left his sickbed to preach what was later called \"\"his own funeral sermon\"\", published posthumously as \"\"Death's Duel.\"\".\tThe elegie was published in 1611 along with 'The Anniversarie: An Anatomy of the World', and again in 1612 to accompany 'The Anniversarie: The Progress of the Soul', lengthy poems on the sinful corruption of man and his means of deliverance.\tThis included most of the 'Elegies', 'Satires' and his love poems, 'Songs and Sonnets'.\tThis was a brilliant defence of the Oath of Allegiance imposed on Catholics after the Gunpowder Plot (1605).\tWith the death of his wife in childbirth the following year, thereafter Donne dedicated his life to his seven remaining children and the church.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0413p",
