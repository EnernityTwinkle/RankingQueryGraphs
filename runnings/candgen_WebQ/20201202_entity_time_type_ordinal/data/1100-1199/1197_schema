On Sunday morning Hello and I lay on our balcony in the sun, on Sunday afternoon he was going to come back, but at about 3 o'clock a policeman arrived and called from the door downstairs, \u2018Miss Margot Frank!\u2019, Mummy went down and the policeman gave her a card which said that Margot Frank had to report to the SS.\"\"\t\"\"Kleiman, who has been here in the meantime, Kugler and the two men have been looking into the question of how to get this fellow out of the place from every possible angle. Downstairs they think it is too risky. But isn\u2019t it even riskier to leave things as they are?\"\"\t\"\"So there we were, Father, Mother and I, walking in the pouring rain, each of us with a satchel and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied assortment of items. The people on their way to work at that early hour gave us sympathetic looks; you could tell by their faces that they were sorry they couldn\u2019t offer us some kind of transport; the conspicuous yellow star spoke for itself.\"\"\t''Because we're Jewish, my father emigrated to Holland in 1933.''\t''It's sweltering. Everyone is huffing and puffing, and in this heat I have to walk everywhere. Only now do I realize how pleasant a streetcar is, but we Jews are no longer allowed to make use of this luxury; our own two feet are good enough for us.''\t''My father, the most precious father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five.''\t***\u201cIf you analyze the discussions, you realize she's not the subject, but the guilty party! \u2026 Stirring up trouble, now that's what [she] calls fun. Stirring up trouble between Mrs. Frank and Anne. Margot and Mr. [Frank] aren't quite as easy. One, she's hard working; two, cheerful; three, coquettish - and sometimes a cute face. That\u2019s Auguste van Pels.\u201d\t... I stuck the craziest things in the bag, but I'm not sorry. Memories mean more to me than dresses.\t.... I know what I want.... If God lets me live,... I'll make my voice heard, I'll go out into the world and work for mankind. I now know that courage and happiness are needed first.\tAnd finally I twist my heart round again, so that the bad is on the outside and the good is on the inside, and keep on trying to find a way of becoming what I would so like to be, and could be, if there weren't any other people living in the world.\tAnd finally I twist my heart round again, so that the bad is on the outside and the good is on the inside, and keep on trying to find a way of becoming what I would so like to be, and could be, if there weren`t any other people living in the world.\tAnd, in most things, my mother is an example for me, but precisely an example of how it shouldn't be.\"\"\tAs long as this exists,'' I thought,''this sunshine and this cloudless sky, and as long as I can enjoy it, how can I be sad?\tBesides, I can't confide in anyone unless they tell me a lot about them-\tDaddy, Mummy and Margot can't get used to the sound of the Westertoren clock yet, which telles us the time every quarter of an hour. I can. I loved it from the start, and especially in the night it's like a faithful friend.\"\"\tEveryone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you don't know how great you can be! How much you can love! What you can accomplish! And what your potential is!\tHow wonderful is is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.\tI don't believe that the big men, the politicians and the capitalists alone are guilty of the war. Oh, no, the little man is just as keen, otherwise the people of the world would have risen in revolt long ago! There is an urge and rage in people to destroy, to kill, to murder, and until all mankind, without exception, undergoes a great change, wars will be waged, everything that has been built up, cultivated and grown, will be destroyed and disfigured, after which mankind will have to begin all over again.\tI feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that every-thing will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more.\tI finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because that's what I want. I know I can write....\tI have often been downcast, but never in despair; I regard our hiding as a dangerous adventure, romantic and interesting at the same time. In my diary I treat all the privations as amusing. I have made up my mind now to lead a different life from other girls and, later on, different from ordinary housewives. My start has been so very full of interest, and that is the sole reason why I have to laugh at the humorous side of the most dangerous moments.\tI keep my ideals, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.\tI want to be useful, or bring enjoy-ment to all people, even those I've never met. I want to go on living even after my death!\tI was stunned. A call-up: Everyone knows what that means. Visions of concentration camps and lonely cells raced through my head.\tI'm used to not being taken seriously, but only the \"\"lighthearted\"\" Anne is used to it and can put up with it; the \"\"deeper\"\" Anne is too weak.\tIs discord going to show itself while we are still fighting, is the Jew once again worth less than another? Oh, it is sad, very sad, that once more, for the umpteenth time, the old truth is confirmed: What one Christian does is his own responsibility, what one Jew does is thrown back at all Jews.\tIt's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet, I keep them, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death. I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness, I hear the ever-approaching thunder, which will destroy us too, I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right, that this cruelty too will end, and that peace and tranquility will return again.\tLast night, just as I was falling asleep, Hanneli suddenly appeared before me. I saw her there, dressed in rags, her face thin and worn.\tLaziness may appear attractive but work gives satisfaction.\tMr. Pfeffer has told us much about the outside world we've missed for so long. He had sad news. Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate.\tMrs. Van Daan's grizzling is absolutely unbearable; now she can't any longer drive us crazy over the invasion, she nags us the whole day long about the bad weather. It really would be nice to dump her in a bucket of cold water and put her up in the loft.\tNo matter what I'm doing, I can't help thinking about those who are gone. I catch myself laughing and remember that it's a disgrace to be so cheerful.\tThat night I thought I was going to die. I waited for the police and I was ready for death, like a soldier on a battlefield. I'd gladly have given my life for my country.\tThe British have begun their all-out attack on Cherbourg. According to father and Mr. Van Daan, we're sure to be liberated before October 10th. The Russians are taking part in the campaign; yesterday they started their offensive near Vitebsk, exactly three years to the day that the Germans invaded Russia.\tThe best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles.\tThe final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands.\tThe two of us looked out at the blue sky, the bare chestnut tree glistening with dew, the seagulls and other birds glinting with silver as they swooped through the air, and we were so moved and entranced that we couldn't speak.\tThey mustn't know my despair, I can't let them see the wounds which they have caused, I couldn't bear their sympathy and their kind-hearted jokes, it would only make me want to scream all the more. If I talk, everyone thinks I'm showing off; when I'm silent they think I'm ridiculous; rude if I answer, sly if I get a good idea, lazy if I'm tired, selfish if I eat a mouthful more than I should, stupid, cowardly, crafty, etc. etc.\tUsually joins in the conversation, never fails to give his opinion. Once he's spoken, his word is final. If anyone dares to suggest otherwise, Mr. Van D. can put up a good fight. Oh, he can hiss like a cat ... but I'd rather he didn't (...) His opinion is the best, he knows the most about everything. Granted, the man has a good head on his shoulders, but it's swelled to no small degree.\tWhen I write I can shake off all my cares. My sorrow disappears, my spirits are revived! But, and that's a big question, will I ever be able to write something great?\tWhoever is happy will make others happy too.\t\u2018Now our secret annexe has truly become secret. Mr Kugler thought it would be better to have a bookcase built in front of the entrance to our hiding place. It swings out on its hinges and opens like a door\u2019.\t\u201cA few weeks ago I started writing a story, something I made up from beginning to end, and I've enjoyed it so much that the products of my pen are piling up.\u201d\t\u201cAfter we arrived at 263 Prinsengracht, Miep quickly led us through the long hallway and up the wooden staircase to the next floor and into the Annex. She shut the door behind us, leaving us alone. Margot had arrived much earlier on her bike and was waiting for us.\u201d\t\u201cAnother fact that doesn't exactly brighten up our days is that Mr. Van Maaren, the man who works in the warehouse, is getting suspicious about the Annex.\u201d\t\u201cBecause this diary has become a kind of memory book, it means a great deal to me, but I could easily write \"\"over and done with\"\" on many of its pages.\u201d\t\u201cBep had a picture postcard of the entire royal family copied for me. Juliana looks very young, and so does the queen. The three little girls are adorable\u201d\t\u201cBy the way, I dreamed about Peter again last night and once again, I felt his eyes penetrate mine, but this dream was less vivid and not quite as beautiful as the last.\u201d\t\u201cBy the way, speaking of Jews, I saw two yesterday when I was peeking through the curtains. I felt as though I were gazing at one of the seven wonders of the world. It gave me such a funny feeling, as if I'd denounced them to the authorities and was now spying on their misfortune.\u201d\t\u201cEvery other week Mr. Kleiman brings me a couple of books written for girls my age. I'm enthusiastic about the Joop ter Heul series. I've enjoyed all of Cissy van Marxveldt's books very much.\u201d\t\u201cFor Christmas we're getting extra cooking oil, candy and molasses. Mr. Dussel gave Mrs. Van Daan and Mother a beautiful cake for Hanukkah, which he'd asked Miep to bake.\u201d\t\u201cFriday evening, for the first time in my life, I received a Christmas present. Mr. Kleiman, Mr. Kugler and the girls had prepared a wonderful surprise for us. Miep made a delicious Christmas cake with \"\"Peace 1944\"\" written on top.\u201d\t\u201cFrom early in the morning to late at night, all I do is think about Peter. I fall asleep with his image before my eyes, dream about him and wake up with him still looking at me.\u201d\t\u201cGreat news! We're planning to take an eighth person into hiding with us! Yes, really. We always thought there was enough room and food for one more person.\u201d\t\u201cHanukkah and St. Nicholas Day nearly coincided this year; they were only one day apart. We didn't make much of a fuss with Hanukkah, merely exchanging a few small gifts and lighting the candles.\u201d\t\u201cHe can't work anymore, and he's just sitting at home, surrounded by his eight children, brooding about his approaching death. I feel very sorry for him and hate not being able to go out, otherwise I'd visit him as often as I could and help take his mind off matters.\u201d\t\u201cI can't help it, the prospect of going back to school in October is making me too happy to be logical! \u201d\t\u201cI confess that I have absolutely no desire to be like Margot. She's too weak-willed and passive to suit me, she lets herself be swayed by others and always backs down under pressure. I want to have more spunk!\u201d\t\u201cI do have the feeling that something beautiful is going to develop between Peter and me, a kind of friendship and a feeling of trust.\u201d\t\u201cI saw my face in the mirror, and it looked so different. My eyes were clear and deep, my cheeks were rosy, which they hadn't been in weeks, my mouth was much softer. I looked happy, and yet there was something so sad in my expression\u2026\u201d\t\u201cI simply can't imagine the world will ever be normal again for us. I do talk about \"\"after the war,\"\" but it's as if I'm talking about a castle in the air, something that can never come true. \u201d\t\u201cI won't say much about Father and me. The former is the most modest person at the table. He always looks to see whether the others have been served first. He needs nothing for himself; the best things are for the children. He's goodness personified. \u201d\t\u201cI've written an amusing story called Blurry the Explorer, which was a big hit with my three listeners.\u201d\t\u201cIt's amazing how much these generous and unselfish people do, risking their own lives to help and save others.\u201d\t\u201cJust as we were starting dinner: another air-raid alarm. The food was good, but I lost my appetite the moment I heard the siren. Nothing happened, however, and forty-five minutes later the all-clear was sounded.\u201d\t\u201cLast night I went downstairs in the dark, all by myself, after having been there with Father a few nights before. I stood at the top of the stairs while German planes flew back and forth, and I knew I was on my own, that I couldn't count on others for support.\u201d\t\u201cMargot and I were in the attic together today. I can't enjoy being there with her the way I imagined it'd be with Peter (or someone else). I know she feels the same about most things as I do!\u201d\t\u201cMargot is very kind and would like me to confide in her, but I can't tell her everything. She takes me too seriously, far too seriously, and spends a lot of time thinking about her loony sister, looking at me closely whenever I open my mouth and wondering: is she acting, or does she really mean it?\u201d\t\u201cMargot's gotten much nicer. She seems a lot different than she used to be. She's not nearly as catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little kid who doesn't count.\u201d\t\u201cMiep came to tell us that she'd been to see Dr. Dussel. He asked her the moment she entered the room if she knew of a hiding place and was enormously pleased when Miep said she had something in mind.\u201d\t\u201cMost of all I long to have a home of our own, to be able to move around freely and have someone help me with my homework again, at last. In other words, to go back to school!\u201d\t\u201cMouschi has now proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that having a cat has disadvantages as well as advantages. The whole house is crawling with fleas, and it's getting worse each day.\u201d\t\u201cMr. Pfeffer has arrived. Everything went smoothly. Miep told him to be at a certain place in front of the post office at 11:00 A.M., where a man would meet him.\u201d\t\u201cMr. Van Pels used to be in the meat, sausage, and spice business. He was hired for his knowledge of spices, and yet, to our great delight, it's his sausage talents that have come in handy now.\u201d\t\u201cMy fountain pen was always one of my most prized possessions; I valued it highly, especially because it had a thick nib, and I can only write neatly with thick nibs.\u201d\t\u201cMy lighter, more superficial side will always steal a march on the deeper side and therefore always win.\u201d\t\u201cMy longing for someone to talk to has become so unbearable that I somehow took it into my head to select Peter for this role. On the few occasions when I have gone to Peter's room during the day, I've always thought it was nice and cozy.\u201d\t\u201cMy mind boggles at the profanity this honorable house has had to endure in the past month. Father walks around with his lips pressed together, and whenever he hears his name, he looks up in alarm, as if he's afraid he'll be called upon to resolve another delicate problem. \u201d\t\u201cSometimes I think it's horrible that you can't ever confide in anyone, not even those closest to you.\u201d\t\u201cTerrible things are happening outside. At any time of night and day, poor helpless people are being dragged out of their homes. They're only allowed to take a knapsack and a little cash with them, and even then, they're robbed of these possessions on the way. Families are torn apart; men, women and children are separated.\u201d\t\u201cThe Van Pels arrived on July 13th. We thought they were coming on the 14th, but from the 13th to 16th the Germans were sending out call-up notices right and left and causing a lot of unrest, so they decided it would be safer to leave a day too early than a day too late.\u201d\t\u201cThe closer it got to St. Nicholas Day, the more we all thought back to last year's festively decorated basket. More than anyone, I thought it would be terrible to skip a celebration this year.\u201d\t\u201cThe more quiet and serious I am on the inside, the noisier I get on the outside! Who will be the first to discover the chink in my armor?\u201d\t\u201cThe strangest things happen to you when you're in hiding! Try to picture this. Because we don't have a bathtub, we wash ourselves in a washtub, and because there's only hot water in the office (by which I mean the entire lower floor), the seven of us take turns making the most of this great opportunity.\u201d\t\u201cThe war is going to go on despite our quarrels and our longing for freedom and fresh air, so we should try to make the best of our stay here.\u201d\t\u201cThinking about the suffering of those you hold dear can reduce you to tears; in fact, you could spend the whole day crying.\u201d\t\u201cThis afternoon, for the first time in ages, Jan gave us some news of the outside world. You should have seen us gathered around him; it looked exactly like a print: \u2018At Grandmother's Knee.\u2019 \u201c\t\u201cWe lit the stove a few days ago and the entire room is filled with smoke. I prefer central heating, and I'm probably not the only one.\u201d\t\u201cWe've all been a little confused this past week, because our dearly beloved Westertoren bells have been carted off to be melted down for the war, so we have no idea of the exact time, either night or day.\u201d\t\u201cWhen we first went into hiding, Father often told me about things I'd rather have heard from Mother, and I learned the rest from books or things I picked up in conversations.\u201d\t\u201cWho could have our key? Why didn't the burglar go to the warehouse? Was it one of our own warehouse employees, and will he turn us in, now that he's heard Mr. Van Daan and maybe even seen him?\u201d\t\u201cYesterday I discovered a new pastime: using a good pair of binoculars to peek into the lighted rooms of the neighbors. During the day our curtains can't be opened, not even an inch, but there's no harm when it's so dark.\u201d\t\u201cYesterday I had a horrible fright. At eight o'clock the doorbell suddenly rang. All I could think of was that someone was coming to get us, you know who I mean. But I calmed down when everybody swore it must have been either pranksters or the mailman.\u201d\t\u201cYesterday was Peter's birthday, his sixteenth. I was upstairs by eight, and Peter and I looked at his presents.\u201d", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.03d9rk", ["people.person.quotations"]]]}
