An extravagant man grows poor by seeming rich.\tA nickel isn't worth a dime today.\tA rich man is nothing but a poor man with money.\tA single idea -- the sudden flash of a thought -- may be worth a million dollars.\tA wise person should have money in their head, but not in their heart.\tAll riches have their origin in mind. Wealth is in ideas -- not money.\tAll social rules and all relations between individuals are eroded by a cash economy, avarice drags Pluto himself out of the bowels of the earth.\tAll things are sold: the very light of heaven is venal; earth's unsparing gifts of love, the smallest and most despicable things that lurk in the abysses of the deep, all objects of our life, even life itself, and the poor pittance which the laws allow of liberty, the fellowship of man, those duties which his heart of human love should urge him to perform instinctively, are bought and sold as in a public mart of not disguising selfishness, that sets on each its price, the stamp-mark of her reign.\tAlmost any man knows how to earn money, but not one in a million knows how to spend it.\tAnyone can be great with money. With money, greatness is not a talent but an obligation. The trick is to be great without money.\tBe not penny-wise. Riches have wings. Sometimes they fly away of themselves, and sometimes they must be set flying to bring in more.\tBusiness, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.\tBut for money and the need of it, there would not be half the friendship in the world. It is powerful for good if divinely used. Give it plenty of air and it is sweet as the hawthorn; shut it up and it cankers and breeds worms.\tBut it is a pretty thing to see what money will do!\tBut money, wife, is the true Fuller's Earth for reputations, there is not a spot or a stain but what it can take out.\tCash-payment never was, or could except for a few years be, the union-bond of man to man. Cash never yet paid one man fully his deserts to another; nor could it, nor can it, now or henceforth to the end of the world.\tComparatively few people know what a million dollars actually is. To the majority it is a gaseous concept, swelling or decreasing as the occasion suggests. In the minds of politicians, perhaps more than anywhere, the notion of a million dollars has this accordion-like ability to expand or contract; if they are disposing of it, the million is a pleasing sum, reflecting warmly upon themselves; if somebody else wants it, it becomes a figure of inordinate size, not to be compassed by the rational mind.\tDoes he council you better who bids you, Money, by right means, if you can: but by any means, make money ?\tDollars! All their cares, hopes, joys, affections, virtues, and associations seemed to be melted down into dollars. Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow cauldron of their talk, they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars. Men were weighed by their dollars, measures were gauged by their dollars; life was auctioned, appraised, put up, and knocked down for its dollars. The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honor and fair-dealing, which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Nature and Good Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars. Make commerce one huge lie and mighty theft. Deface the banner of the nation for an idle rag; pollute it star by star; and cut out stripe by stripe as from the arm of a degraded soldier. Do anything for dollars! What is a flag to them!\tDon't ever let economic alone determine your career or how you spend the majority of your time.\tEconomy is half the battle of life. It is not so hard to earn money as to spend it well.\tFinance, like time, devours its own children.\tGetting money is like digging with a needle, spending it is like water soaking into sand.\tGod gave me my money. I believe the power to make money is a gift from God . to be developed and used to the best of our ability for the good of mankind.

I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.\tI'm tired of love; I'm still more tired of rhyme; but money gives me pleasure all the time.\tIdeas are the beginning points of all fortunes.\tIf a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life.\tIf money be not they servant, it will be thy master.

If you're going to give money make sure nobody else is around.\tIn any country where talent and virtue produce no advancement, money will be the national god. Its inhabitants will either have to possess money or make others believe that they do. Wealth will be the highest virtue, poverty the greatest vice. Those who have money will display it in every imaginable way. If their ostentation does not exceed their fortune, all will be well. But if their ostentation does exceed their fortune they will ruin themselves. In such a country, the greatest fortunes will vanish in the twinkling of an eye. Those who don't have money will ruin themselves with vain efforts to conceal their poverty. That is one kind of affluence: the outward sign of wealth for a small number, the mask of poverty for the majority, and a source of corruption for all.\tIt doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor -- as long as you've got money.\tIt is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.\tIt is better that a man should tyrannize over his bank balance than over his fellow-citizens and whilst the former is sometimes denounced as being but a means to the latter, sometimes at least it is an alternative.\tIt is not how much one makes but to what purpose one spends.\tIt is only the poor who pay cash, and that not from virtue, but because they are refused credit.\tIt is the heart that makes a man rich. He is rich according to what he is, not according to what he has.\tIt requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution to make a great fortune, and when you have it, it requires ten times as much skill to keep it.\tIt's important to me that money not be important to me.\tLack of money is the root of all evil.\tMake all you can, save all you can, give all you can.\tMany folks think they aren't good at earning money, when what they don't know is how to use it.\tMany of the things you can count, don't count. Many of the things you can't count, really count.\tMany people make the mistake of thinking that all the challenges in their lives would dissipate if they just had enough money. Nothing could be further from the truth. Earning more money, in and of itself, rarely frees people. It's equally ridiculous to tell yourself that greater financial freedom and mastery of your finances would not offer your greater opportunities to expand, share, and create value for yourself and others.\tMany people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it, and others do just the same with their time.\tModern man is frantically trying to earn enough to buy things he's too busy to enjoy.\tMoney begets money.\tMoney can't buy happiness; it can, however, rent it.\tMoney can't buy health, happiness, or what it did last year.\tMoney cannot buy peace of mind. It cannot heal ruptured relationships, or build meaning into a life that has none.\tMoney differs from an automobile or mistress in being equally important to those who have it and those who do not.\tMoney doesn't always bring happiness. A man with ten million dollars is no happier than a man with nine million dollars.\tMoney doesn't talk, it swears.\tMoney has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants.\tMoney is a singular thing. It ranks with love as man's greatest source of joy. And with death as his greatest source of anxiety. Over all history it has oppressed nearly all people in one of two ways: either it has been abundant and very unreliable, or reliable and very scarce.\tMoney is always there but the pockets change.\tMoney is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.\tMoney is flat and meant to be piled up.\tMoney is good, love is wealth.\tMoney is human happiness in the abstract: he, then, who is no longer capable of enjoying human happiness in the concrete devotes his heart entirely to money.\tMoney is indeed the most important thing in the world; and all sound and successful personal and national morality should have this fact for its basis.\tMoney is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five.\tMoney is like an arm or leg -- use it or lose it.\tMoney is like fire, an element as little troubled by moralizing as earth, air and water. Men can employ it as a tool or they can dance around it as if it were the incarnation of a god. Money votes socialist or monarchist, finds a profit in pornography or translations from the Bible, commissions Rembrandt and underwrites the technology of Auschwitz. It acquires its meaning from the uses to which it is put.\tMoney is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and enlivens the other who turns it on his fellow man.\tMoney is like manure. You have to spread it around or it smells.\tMoney is like muck, not good except it be spread.\tMoney is not required to buy one necessity of the soul.\tMoney is the fruit of evil, as often as the root of it.\tMoney is the most important thing in the world. It represents health, strength, honor, generosity, and beauty as conspicuously as the want of it represents illness, weakness, disgrace, meanness, and ugliness.\tMoney is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity. It is so much warmth, so much bread.\tMoney is the seed of money, and the first guinea is sometimes more difficult to acquire than the second million.\tMoney is the sinews of love, as of war.\tMoney is truthful. If a man speaks of honor, make him pay cash.\tMoney is usually attracted, not pursued.\tMoney makes a good servant, but a bad master.\tMoney may be the husk of many things, but not the kernel. It brings you food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness; days of joy, but not peace and happiness.\tMoney never made a fool of anybody; it only shows them up.\tMoney often costs too much.\tMoney speaks, but it speaks with a male voice.\tMoney talks and often just says, Good Bye.\tMoney was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.\tMoney will buy a bed but not sleep; books but not brains; food but not appetite; finery but not beauty; a house but not a home; medicine but not health; luxuries but not culture; amusements but not happiness; religion but not salvation; a passport to everywhere but heaven.\tMoney will say more in one moment than the most eloquent lover can in years.\tMoney without brains is always dangerous.\tMoney won't make you happy... but everybody wants to find out for themselves.\tMoney's a horrid thing to follow, but a charming thing to meet.\tMoney, it turned out, was exactly like sex, you thought of nothing else if you didn't have it and thought of other things if you did.\tMoney, which represents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.\tMore gold has been mined from the thoughts of men than has been taken from the earth.\tNever underestimate the value of cold cash.\tNo man's credit is ever as good as his money.\tNo man's fortune can be an end worthy of his being.\tNowadays nothing but money counts: a fortune brings honors, friendships, the poor man everywhere lies low.\tOnce upon a time only Washington's face was on our money, now Washington's hands are on it too.\tOur income are like our shoes; if too small, they gall and pinch us; but if too large, they cause us to stumble and trip.\tPart of your heritage in this society is the opportunity to become financially independent.\tPreoccupation with money is the great test of small natures, but only a small test of great ones.\tProfits are an opinion, cash is a fact.\tReady money is Aladdin's lamp.\tRevenue is vanity... margin is sanity... cash is king.\tRule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.\tSex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional and be genuinely regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.\tSir, money, money, the most charming of all things; money, which will say more in one moment than the most elegant lover can in years. Perhaps you will say a man is not young; I answer he is rich. He is not genteel, handsome, witty, brave, good-humored, but he is rich, rich, rich, rich, rich --that one word contradicts everything you can say against him.\tSuccessful people make money. It's not that people who make money become successful, but that successful people attract money. They bring success to what they do.\tTake a dollar from a thousand and it will be a thousand no more.\tTaking it all in all, I find it is more trouble to watch after money than to get it.\tThe Lord commonly gives riches to foolish people, to whom he gives nothing else.\tThe buck stops here.\tThe chief value of money lies in the fact that one lives in a world in which it is overestimated.\tThe covetous man never has money. The prodigal will have none shortly.\tThe day, water, sun, moon, night -- I do not have to purchase these things with money.\tThe highest use of capital is not to make more money, but to make money do to more for the betterment of life.\tThe importance of money flows from it being a link between the present and the future.\tThe lack of money is the root of all evils.\tThe love of money grows as the money itself grows.\tThe love of money is the root of all evil.\tThe money men make lives after them.\tThe more you learn to live without, the more you'll have to live with.\tThe most valuable of all human possessions, next to a superior and disdainful air, is the reputation of being well-to-do.\tThe only wealth is life.\tThe poor man's budget is full of schemes.\tThe price we have to pay for money is sometimes liberty.\tThe safest way to double your money is to fold over once and put it in your pocket.\tThe trick is to make sure you don't die waiting for prosperity to come.\tThe universal regard for money is the one hopeful fact in our civilization. Money is the most important thing in the world. It represents health, strength, honor, generosity and beauty. Not the least of its virtues is that it destroys base people as certainly as it fortifies and dignifies noble people.\tThe use of money is all the advantage there is in having money.\tThe want of money is the root of all evil.\tThe way by which you may get money almost without exception leads downward.\tThe world is his who has money to go over it.\tThere are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money.\tThere are people who have money and people who are rich.\tThere is a strange and mighty race of people called the Americans who are rapidly becoming the coldest in the world because of this cruel, man-eating idol, lucre.\tThere is no fortune so strong that money cannot take it.\tThere is no intrinsic worth in money but what is alterable with the times, and whether a guinea goes for twenty pounds or for a shilling, it is the labor of the poor and not the high and low value that is set on gold or silver, which all the comforts of life must arise from.\tThere is nothing so habit-forming as money.\tThere is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor.
