into a coil of wire, he observed that a current was generated in the wire.\tDavy advised Faraday to give up the idea of becoming a scientist because of the difficulty in making a living.\tDavy had observed that when electricity was passed through certain chemicals or chemical solutions, it could break them down.\tDuring the course of his experiments,  Faraday produced some new chemical compounds from chlorine and carbon, including tetrachloride, used in stain-removing and fire extinguishers.\tFaraday also developed borosilicate glass (heat resistant glass) which he came across while working to produce new kinds of optical glass.\tFaraday got the job.\tFaraday thus opened the way for electricity to become one of the most important sources of energy.\tFollowing Oersted's discovery of the influence of an electric current when passed parallel to a compass needle, Faraday conducted an experiment proving that a freely suspended current-carrying wire rotates around the pole of a magnet.\tFrom this discovery, Faraday went on to produce electricity from ordinary magnetism.\tHe also showed that an electric current can be measured by how much electrolyte it decomposes.\tHe lectured on this discovery at the Royal Society in 1820.\tHe met Italian physicist Volta and French physicist Andre-Marie Ampere In 1825, Davy made him Director of the Laboratory.\tHe was a member of 70 learned societies worldwide, and held 90 other honorary titles.\tHe was concerned that contemporaries such as classical scientist Whewell of Trinity College, Cambridge, might have wrong preconceptions, so he thought up new words such as \"\"anode\"\", \"\"cathode\"\" and \"\"ion\"\", many of which are still used in science today.\tHe was immediately accused of having stolen this idea from English chemist Wollaston, and of not having acknowledged Davy's contribution to his work.\tHe was offered the presidency of the Royal Society, but declined, never having been interested in the politics of the scientific world.\tHenry, Joseph may have anticipated his induction discovery.\tHis discovery appeared in \"\"Philosophical Transactions\"\" in 1832.\tHowever, during an experiment Davy injured his eyes with a shower of glass and hot chemicals, and from then on needed an assistant.\tIn 1823, Faraday made his most significant chemical discovery:  the liquefaction of gases.\tIn 1826, Faraday founded the Friday Evening Discourses and, the next year, the Juvenile Christmas Lectures, public occasions that raised the profile of science.\tIn 1829, he became professor of chemistry at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, where he was responsible for giving 25 lectures a year.\tIn 1833, Faraday showed that the breakdowns depended on the strength of the current.\tIn 1833, he was appointed Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution, a post he held until his death.\tIn 1834, Faraday realized that the way a chemical is broken down by electricity was related to the structure of the substance itself.\tIn the autumn of 1813 Davy took Faraday on an 18-month trip to visit scientists in France, Italy, Germany and Belgium.\tLike many others scientists, Faraday was intrigued by the hypothesis that if electricity could be used to produce magnetism, then magnetism could be used to generate electricity.\tNonetheless, the discovery allowed Faraday to convert electrical force into mechanical force, and in so doing,  to discover the principle of the electric motor.\tOne day, his boss showed some of Faraday's notes to a customer who was also a member of the Royal Institution.\tOut of this work came the famous Faraday Laws.\tThe customer was so impressed, he bought Faraday tickets to a series of four lectures given by chemist Davy Before the lectures, Faraday's notes were sent to Davy, who invited him to come to see him.\tThe discovery also led to the foundation of electrochemistry and the development of the system of electroplating.\tThe following year, he discovered benzene, a chemical he extracted from the residue left after the burning of oil-gas, used for lighting.\tThe government awarded him a special pension for his services in 1835, and Queen Victoria allowed him and his wife a house at Hampton Court in 1858, where he lived until the end of his life in 1867.\tThe success of the lectures owed in large part to Faraday's brilliant lecturing style.\tThese ideas are contained in what is known now as Faraday's First Law.\tThis was the discovery of equivalents in electro-chemical decomposition.\tThis was the first dynamo, which, though basic in design, operated with the same principles used in the modern electric power industry.\tThough first apprenticed to a bookbinder, Faraday attended lectures at the London City Philosophical Society, taking notes, commenting not only on the content of the lectures, but their style of delivery.\tTo explain his work, Faraday chose to drop the old scientific terms for electricity, which he considered outdated and misleading.\tWork related to that of Nasmyth, Brugnatelli^?, Joule?^, Drummond, Crookes, Sturgeon and Arago. He knew Baily, Somerville and Cavendish. He taught Benjamin Richardson.  He influenced Whitehead.
