We collect into a small bunch the flowers, the few flowers, which brought sweetness into a life, and present it as an offering to an accomplished destiny. It is the dying refrain of a completed song, the final verse of a finished poem.\tA well-written life is almost as rare as a well-spent one.\tAll good biography, as all good fiction, comes down to the study of original sin, of our inherent disposition to choose death when we ought to choose life.\tAlmost any biographer, if he respects facts, can give us much more than another fact to add to our collection. He can give us the creative fact; the fertile fact; the fact that suggests and engenders.\tBiographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man. The biography of the man himself cannot be written.\tBiography is: a system in which the contradictions of a human life are unified.\tBiography should be written by an acute enemy.\tFormerly we used to canonize our heroes. The modern method is to vulgarize them. Cheap editions of great books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable.\tGreat geniuses have the shortest biographies.\tHistory is the essence of innumerable biographies.\tI am opposed to writing about the private lives of living authors and psychoanalyzing them while they are alive. Criticism is getting all mixed up with a combination of the Junior F.B.I. -men, discards from Freud and Jung and a sort of Columnist peep-hole and missing laundry list school. Every young English professor sees gold in them dirty sheets now. Imagine what they can do with the soiled sheets of four legal beds by the same writer and you can see why their tongues are slavering.\tIf those gentlemen would let me alone I should be much obliged to them. I would say, as Shakespeare would say... Sweet Friend, for Jesus sake forbear.\tJust as there is nothing between the admirable omelet and the intolerable, so with autobiography.\tJust how difficult it is to write biography can be reckoned by anybody who sits down and considers just how many people know the real truth about his or her love affairs.\tMany heroes lived before Agamemnon; but all are unknown and unwept, extinguished in everlasting night, because they have no spirited chronicler.\tMemoirs are the backstairs of history.\tNo sooner does a great man depart, and leave his character as public property, than a crowd of little men rushes towards it. There they are gathered together, blinking up to it with such vision as they have, scanning it from afar, hovering round it this way and that, each cunningly endeavoring, by all arts, to catch some reflex of it in the little mirror of himself.\tNobody can write the life of a man but those who have eat and drunk and lived in social intercourse with him.\tOnly when one has lost all curiosity about the future has one reached the age to write an autobiography.\tRead no history: nothing but biography, for that is life without theory.\tThe immense majority of human biographies are a gray transit between domestic spasm and oblivion.\tThere ain't nothing that breaks up homes, country, and nations like somebody publishing their memoirs.\tThere is properly no history; only biography.\tThere never was a good biography of a good novelist. There couldn't be. He is too many people, if he's any good.\tThere was never yet an uninteresting life. Such a thing is an impossibility. Inside of the dullest exterior there is a drama, a comedy, and a tragedy.\tTo write the lives of the great in separating them from their works necessarily ends by above all stressing their pettiness, because it is in their work that they have put the best of themselves.\tWhen my journal appears, many statues must come down.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.017fp", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
