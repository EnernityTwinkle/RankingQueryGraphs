Night'.\tAfter one semester at Dartmouth, Frost went to work in a woollen mill in Lawrence, trimming lamps, before becoming a schoolteacher.\tAs such a respected US citizen,  the State Department sent Frost on goodwill missions that took him to Brazil in 1954, Britain in 1957 and Greece in 1961.\tAt Amherst, Frost had found a lifestyle that agreed with him and he spent the rest of his life in a cycle of teaching at Amherst, the University of Michigan and Dartmouth, as well as going on poetry recital tours.\tBoth of them worked as teachers, while Frost continued to write.\tBy March 1913, he had started to move in literary circles and the American writer, Pound, working as a reviewer, introduced him to the poets Yeats and Ford Madox Ford.\tBy now, Frost was considered to be one of the leading poets in England.\tFor a while he worked as a reporter, then went back to teaching and, at the end of 1895,  married his childhood sweetheart Elinor White, after she had finished college.\tFor the next few years, Frost worked on the farm and wrote at night, contributing poetry and articles to poultry journals.\tFrost collapsed under the strain and, when their landlord evicted them in the fall, Elinor took charge.\tFrost enjoyed being high in the literary elite, particularly when he was made Phi Beta Kappa poet at Harvard and then was  elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters.\tFrost never stopped writing and published 'A Witness Tree',  which won him a fourth Pulitzer Prize in 1942 and contained some of his best poems, like 'The Most of It' and 'The Silken Tent'.\tFrost was considered a supreme advocate for the New England countryside and the life and speech of ordinary country people.\tFrost was involved in athletics, the re-organization of the English curriculum and helping with student activities, and he became a great success as a teacher.\tFrost's last volume of poetry, 'In the Clearing', was published in 1962 and a few months later, Kennedy asked Frost to visit the Soviet Union.\tHe spent his last years as an honoured citizen and was invited to read a poem at the inauguration of President Kennedy.\tHe was taught by Santayana.\tHer mother found them a farm in Derry, New Hampshire and Elinor persuaded Frost's grandfather to pay for it.\tHis career was as successful as anybody could want, but from 1938, his private life began to fall apart.\tHis son committed suicide and his daughter Irma was committed to a psychiatric institute.\tIn 1897, he went to Harvard to train as a high school teacher of Latin and Greek but when his health broke down in spring 1899 he left.\tIn 1911, he left to take a part time job in Plymouth, New Hampshire, then, in 1912, he and his family went to Britain, arriving in September.\tIn 1915, a New York publisher agreed to publish his books in America, so he went back to the US, to be greeted as one of the leading poets in the new realistic movement that celebrated the American countryside and its people.\tIn 1923, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his collection of short lyric poems in 'New Hampshire', then again in 1930, for 'Collected Poems' and another in 1937, for 'A Further Range'.\tIn May 1914, 'North of Boston', a collection of poems in the real speech of ordinary working people in the New England countryside (and mostly written on the farm in Derry) was published to a good reception.\tIn October 1912, 'A Boy's Will' was accepted for publication and,  encouraged, he entered a new period of creativity.\tIn his private life, though, he was still a troubled and anxious man.\tIn his spare time, he wrote poetry and, in 1894, the 'Independent', a weekly literary magazine in New York, published his poem 'My Butterfly: an Elegy'.\tIn that year, Elinor died and Frost seemed to be heading for a breakdown, until Kathleen Morrison took him in hand.\tIt was a hard life and, by 1906, there were four children in the family.\tThe 1940s saw more tragedy for Frost.\tThe Frost's rented a poultry farm in Methuen in April 1900, but tragedy struck when their three-year old son died of cholera two months later.\tThe family moved further from London to Gloucestershire, where they could live more cheaply.\tThe poems revealed the influence of Wordsworth and Robert Browning and the collection included some of Frost's most enduring work, including 'Mending Wall', 'The Death of the Hired Man', 'Home Burial' and 'After Apple-Picking'.\tThe poet T S Eliot, who in 1922 had shown himself to be one of Frost's greatest critics, praised him in 1957 as the most distinguished Anglo-American poet.\tThe two formed a close relationship and she became his secretary and manager.\tThen, in 1917, Frost moved to Amherst and took a job at the college, with complete freedom over his choice of teaching subjects.\tThey set up home in a country cottage near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire and Frost toured bookshops and publishers in London, in an effort to find a publisher for some of the work he had done in Derry.\tTo supplement their income, he took a teaching job at the nearby Pinkerton Academy.\tWhile he was there, he met Russian writers, as well as the first secretary of the Communist Party and Prime Minister, Krushchev.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.06gq_",
