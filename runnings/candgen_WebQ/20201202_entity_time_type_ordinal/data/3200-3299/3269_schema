{"p": 0.0, "r": 0.0, "f1": 0, "ans_size": 39, "hops": 1, "ans_str": "(Important information about atomic structure can be seen from the separation of these lines)\tAfter a six-month internment in England, Heisenberg was allowed to return to Gottingen, where he re-established the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, renaming it the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics, and moving with the Institute to Munich in 1958.\tAfter a year of investigations and interrogations, Himmler disavowed the charges in 1938, but Heisenberg was never permitted to take the Munich job.\tAs a result of  political interference, Heisenberg, together with physicists Max Wein and Geiger, composed a paper addressed to the Nazi government complaining about the treatment of theoretical physics in Germany.\tAt the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, the Nazi government realized Heisenberg's value and made him director of the German atomic bomb project, and for the next five and a half years, all his energies were devoted to this.\tAt the end of the war, Heisenberg and his bomb research team were captured in a remote region of southern Germany, where they had been sent to avoid Allied bomb attacks.\tBecause of this work, Heisenberg is regarded as the founder of quantum mechanics, which seeks to explain atomic structure in mathematical terms.\tBohr had used the quantum concept of German physicist Planck to explain the spectral lines of atoms in terms of the energy differences of electron orbits at various quantum states.\tBohr's concept (what is now called the old quantum theory) had been based on the classical idea of electrons in well-defined orbits around the nucleus.\tBut it then occurred to him that the very act of measuring an electron's properties by shining gamma rays on it would disturb the electron in its orbit.\tBut it was quickly and widely accepted by most physicists, who soon acknowledged it as a fundamental law of nature.\tBy the mathematical treatment of ordered sets of data forming a matrix, or array, Heisenberg obtained the frequencies of the lines in the hydrogen spectrum, the first precise mathematical description of the workings of the atom.\tFellow students included the Italian Fermi, Englishman Dirac, and Heisenberg's lifelong friend and collaborator, Austrian Pauli, all of them future luminaries in physics.\tHaving decided that physicists had devoted too much effort to devising pictorial models of what happens inside the atom, he set about using experimental data to devise a mathematical system that explained the properties of the atom -- in this case, the position of the spectral lines given by hydrogen, the simplest atom.\tHe decided to write directly to the head of the S.S., Himmler, requesting an official disavowal of the charges and a termination of the campaign against him and his physics.\tHe retired in 1970, and died six years later.\tHeisenberg began investigating the refinement of the model of the atom, developed in 1913 by Bohr.\tHeisenberg was branded a \"\"white Jew\"\" in the Nazi press, and was fired.\tHeisenberg's idea was revolutionary, and a vocal minority (including Schrodinger, Planck and German physicist Einstein) refused to accept it.\tHeisenberg's uncertainty principle negated cause and effect, maintaining that the result of an action can be expressed only in terms of the probability that a certain effect will occur.\tHis theory was developed by Neumann.\tIn 1920 Heisenberg enrolled for the physics course at Munich University.\tIn 1920-21, Heisenberg first investigated the strange Zeeman effect:  the unexplained splitting of single atomic spectral lines into groups of closely spaced lines in a strong magnetic field.\tIn 1925, Heisenberg (by now working with Born at Gottingen)  developed a new approach to the problem of the Zeeman effect in particular, and of atomic theory in general.\tIn 1926, Heisenberg left Gottingen to become Bohr's assistant in Copenhagen.\tIn 1932, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics.\tIn other words, the act of observing the electron altered its behavior, and objectivity was lost.\tIn the 1930s, with the rise of Nazism in Germany, most German scientists fled the country for the United Kingdom, the United States or other nations, but Heisenberg -- along with his colleague Otto Hahn, who was one of the discoverers of nuclear fission -- chose to remain behind, wishing to protect Germany's scientific traditions and institutions.\tIt was signed by 75 of Germany's most notable physicists and presented to the Reich Education Ministry in late 1936.\tKnew Laue.\tLater in 1927, Heisenberg took the post of Professor at Leipzig University and among his first students and collaborators was Teller.\tOne of the seminal scientific thinkers of the 20th century, discovered the uncertainty principle in 1927, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1932.\tOut of this, he developed a fundamental principle of physics, which states that one can measure the position of a particle or its momentum, but the more precise one of these measurements becomes, the less precise the other will be, such that the product of their \"\"inaccuracies\"\" must always be less than Planck's constant (the unvarying ratio of the frequency of radiation to its quanta of energy).\tThe conflict between the two systems was resolved when Schrodinger showed that \"\"matrix\"\" mechanics and \"\"wave\"\" mechanics were mathematically identical.\tThe mathematical system Heisenberg devised came to be known as \"\"matrix mechanics\"\".\tThe next year, he made the discovery for which he is best known: the \"\"uncertainty principle\"\".\tThe problem was that no theoretical basis existed for the concept of the orbits.\tWhen Austrian physicist Schrodinger produced his \"\"wave mechanics\"\" the following year, the majority of physicists gladly switched from the mathematical abstraction of Heisenberg's method to this more physically-based approach.\tWhile studying the fundamental quantum properties of an electron in its orbit around the nucleus, he thought about using a gamma ray microscope to study an electron's motion.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0825l", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
