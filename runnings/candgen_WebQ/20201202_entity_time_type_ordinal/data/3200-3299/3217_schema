Like a person with two wooden legs getting another person with two wooden legs to guarantee that he has got two natural legs. It don't make either of them able to do a walking-match.\tA prison taint was on everything there. The imprisoned air, the imprisoned light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all deteriorated by confinement. As the captive men were faded and haggard, so the iron was rusty, the stone was slimy, the wood was rotten, the air was faint, the light was dim. Like a well, like a vault, like a tomb, the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside; and would have kept its polluted atmosphere intact, in one of the spice islands of the Indian Ocean.\tA wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.\tAccidents will occur in the best-regulated families; and in families not regulated by that pervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances... in short, by the influence of Woman, in the lofty character of Wife, they may be expected with confidence, and must be borne with philosophy.\tAnything for the quick life, as the man said when he took the situation at the lighthouse.\tBring in the bottled lightning, a clean tumbler, and a corkscrew.\tChange begets change. Nothing propagates so fast. If a man habituated to a narrow circle of cares and pleasures, out of which he seldom travels, step beyond it, though for never so brief a space, his departure from the monotonous scene on which he has been an actor of importance would seem to be the signal for instant confusion. The mine which Time has slowly dug beneath familiar objects is sprung in an instant; and what was rock before, becomes but sand and dust.\tCharity begins at home, and justice begins next door.\tCheerfulness and contentment are great beautifiers and are famous preservers of youthful looks.\tCredit is a system whereby a person who can not pay gets another person who can not pay to guarantee that he can pay.\tDollars! All their cares, hopes, joys, affections, virtues, and associations seemed to be melted down into dollars. Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow cauldron of their talk, they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars. Men were weighed by their dollars, measures were gauged by their dollars; life was auctioned, appraised, put up, and knocked down for its dollars. The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honor and fair-dealing, which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Nature and Good Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars. Make commerce one huge lie and mighty theft. Deface the banner of the nation for an idle rag; pollute it star by star; and cut out stripe by stripe as from the arm of a degraded soldier. Do anything for dollars! What is a flag to them!\tElectric communication will never be a substitute for the face of someone who with their soul encourages another person to be brave and true.\tFan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship; and pass the rosy wine.\tFather Time is not always a hard parent, and, though he tarries for none of his children, often lays his hand lightly upon those who have used him well; making them old men and women inexorably enough, but leaving their hearts and spirits young and in full vigor. With such people the gray head is but the impression of the old fellow's hand in giving them his blessing, and every wrinkle but a notch in the quiet calendar of a well-spent life.\tGod bless us every one! said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\tGreat men are seldom over-scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire.\tHe had but one eye and the pocket of prejudice runs in favor of two.\tHe would make a lovely corpse.\tHere's the rule for bargains: Do other men, for they would do you.

No man can form an adequate idea of the real meaning of the word, without coming here.\tI believe no satirist could breathe this air. If another Juvenal or Swift could rise up among us tomorrow, he would be hunted down. If you have any knowledge of our literature, and can give me the name of any man, American born and bred, who has anatomized our follies as a people, and not as this or that party; and who has escaped the foulest and most brutal slander, the most inveterate hatred and intolerant pursuit; it will be a strange name in my ears, believe me.\tI do not know the American gentleman, God forgive me for putting two such words together.\tI feel an earnest and humble desire, and shall till I die, to increase the stock of harmless cheerfulness.\tI have known a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in the face. Don't trust that conventional idea. Dishonesty will stare honesty out of countenance any day in the week, if there is anything to be got by it.\tI never could have done what I have done without the habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one subject at a time...\tI never see any difference in boys. I only know two sorts of boys. Mealy boys and beef-faced boys.\tI revere the memory of Mr. F. as an estimable man and most indulgent husband, only necessary to mention Asparagus and it appeared or to hint at any little delicate thing to drink and it came like magic in a pint bottle; it was not ecstasy but it was comfort.\tIf its individual citizens, to a man, are to be believed, it always is depressed, and always is stagnated, and always is at an alarming crisis, and never was otherwise; though as a body, they are ready to make oath upon the Evangelists, at any hour of the day or night, that it is the most thriving and prosperous of all countries on the habitable globe.\tIf the law supposes that, said Mr. Bumble, the law is a assa idiot. If thats the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experienceby experience.\tIf there were no bad people, there would be no good lawyers.\tIndustry is the soul of business and the keystone of prosperity.\tIt is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations.\tIt is a pleasant thing to reflect upon, and furnishes a complete answer to those who contend for the gradual degeneration of the human species, that every baby born into the world is a finer one than the last.\tIt opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper; so cry away.\tIt was a foggy day in London, and the fog was heavy and dark. Animate London, with smarting eyes and irritated lungs, was blinking, wheezing, and choking; inanimate London was a sooty spectre, divided in purpose between being visible and invisible, and so being wholly neither.\tIt was a good thing to have a couple of thousand people all rigid and frozen together, in the palm of one's hand.\tIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayin short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\tIt's my old girl that advises. She has the head. But I never own to it before her. Discipline must be maintained.\tIts very strange, said Mr. Dick that I never can get that quite right; I never can make that perfectly clear.\tKeep out of Chancery. It's being ground to bits in a slow mill; it's being roasted at a slow fire; it's being stung to death by single bees; it's being drowned by drops; it's going mad by grains.\tLet us be moral. Let us contemplate existence.\tLife is made of ever so many partings welded together.\tLord, keep my memory green.\tMany merry Christmases, friendships, great accumulation of cheerful recollections, affection on earth, and Heaven at last for all of us.\tMind like bodies, will often fall into a pimpled, ill-conditioned state from mere excess of comfort.\tMinds, like bodies, will fall into a pimpled, ill-conditioned state from mere excess of comfort.\tMinerva House was a finishing establishment for young ladies, where some twenty girls of the ages from thirteen to nineteen inclusive, acquired a smattering of everything and a knowledge of nothing.\tMy other piece of advice, Copperfield, said Mr. Micawber, you know.

Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children.
