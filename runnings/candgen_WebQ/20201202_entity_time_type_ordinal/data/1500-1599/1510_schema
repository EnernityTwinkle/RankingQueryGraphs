Stoddart of 'Lippincott's Magazine' and Wilde, who had been signed up to write 'The Picture of Dorian Gray'.\tDoyle wrote his own detective story, 'A Study in Scarlett', which appeared in 'Beeton's Christmas Annual' in 1887.\tHe knew Sir Walter Besant.\tHe published his two-volume 'History of Spiritualism' in 1926, but after a tour of Scandinavia and Holland in 1929, returned exhausted to England and suffered a heart attack.\tHe published work in 'The Idler', a magazine run by the writer Jerome K. Jerome, who soon became a friend.\tHe spent the winter of 1895-96 working as a war correspondent for the 'Westminster Gazette' in Cairo.\tHe started to write his six-volume history, 'The British Campaign in France and Flanders', in 1915, finishing it in 1920.\tHe visited the battlefronts of the British, French and Italians, where he interviewed Haig and other generals,  in his job as war correspondent.\tHis \"\"Valley of Fear\"\" hero was based on American detective McParlan.\tHis first attempt at a novel, 'The Narrative of John Smith,' was lost in the post on the way to the publisher in 1883 and his second novel, the 'The Firm of Girdlestone,'  written in 1884, waited years before he found a publisher.\tHis first story, \"\"Habakuk Jephson's Statement\"\", based on the mystery of the Marie Celeste, was accepted by the 'Cornhill Magazine' in 1883.\tHis major collections of stories, of Sherlock Holmes, Professor Challenger and Brigadier Gerard, continue to be read and enjoyed.\tHis work related to that of Tylor.\tIn 1882, he set up a successful general practice in Southsea, England, where he began writing short stories in his spare time.\tIn 1886, he started to develop an interest in psychic studies and spiritualism.\tIn 1891, he was paid to write a series of short stories about Sherlock Holmes for the 'Strand Magazine' and, within weeks, both Doyle and Holmes were well-known.\tIn 1900, Doyle was given a knighthood by Queen Victoria, alongside the physicist Lodge who was a co- spiritualist.\tIn 1912, he published another successful work, 'The Lost World', an early example of science fiction which introduced the character Professor Challenger, who enjoyed further adventures in 'The Poison Belt' in 1913.\tMeanwhile Doyle attempted to move into politics, twice standing for Parliament,  but was unsuccessful on both occasions.\tMet the detective, WJ Burns and poet Gerald Manley Hopkins.\tSoon, Doyle was regularly having his adventure stories printed in journals like 'London Society',  'All the Year Round' and the 'Boy's Own Paper'.\tSpiritualism became the driving force in his life and he made lecture tours to Australia, America, Canada and South Africa.\tThe result of their discussions led Doyle to write the next Holmes book, 'The Sign of Four', which he completed the following year.\tThe stories were soon collected into book form and published as 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' in 1892, followed by 'The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes' in 1894.\tThese stories were collected as 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' in 1905, but his greatest success was with the novel 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' in 1902.\tThis story introduced the private detective Sherlock Holmes, whose character may have been partly based on the 19th-century American detective Pinkerton.\tThis ultimately caused his death a few months later.\tThis was published in December 1893, in 'The Strand' and Holmes fans from both sides of the Atlantic mourned his death, sending Doyle hundreds of letters, asking him to bring their hero back from the dead.\tTwo years later, he used his knowledge of Cairo, when he adopted it as the setting for 'The Tragedy of Korosko'.\tTwo years later, he was given the rank of Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey.\tWas a member of the Society for Psychic Research with authors Carroll, Tennyson,  and physicist JJ Thomson.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0ky1", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
