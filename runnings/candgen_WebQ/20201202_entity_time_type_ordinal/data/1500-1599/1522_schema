revolutionized thought in the last half of the 19th century.\tA major exception was Lyell, president of the Geological Society, who saw his own evolutionary theories confirmed by many of Darwin's discoveries.\tAnother was Joseph Hooker, who had spent four years in the Antarctic.\tApplying this theory to animals, Darwin concluded that certain species might survive adverse changes in physical conditions, while others might not.\tAt 22, Darwin took part in a geological field trip through Wales led by geologist Sedgwick .\tBefore he began his famed expedition, Darwin held to the theory that all species had fixed forms.\tBut Darwin's ideas steadily gained ground.\tBut despite his reputation, Darwin found on his return that few of his fellow naturalists were interested in helping him identify his specimens.\tBut in \"\"The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex\"\", published in 1871, he argued that people had evolved in the same way as other animals and that the ancestors of the human race came from among the primates.\tBut in South America he found fossils of extinct creatures, such as the giant sloth, and on the Galapagos Islands, he identified fourteen sub-species of a colony of finches, though none existed on the mainland.\tContrary to common belief, Darwin did not expand his ideas to include the human race in \"\"The Origin of the Species\"\".\tDarwin could not come to a theory of how adaptation occurred, but he was aware that something similar had been happening in the cultivation of plants and domestic animals since ancient times.\tDarwin made notes about and collected anything that could remotely be of interest to natural science.\tDarwin was also unhappy about how Marx used his theory, and declined Marx's offer to dedicate the English edition of \"\"Das Kapital\"\" to him.\tDarwin was careful not make his ideas public without double-checking.\tFor the rest of his life, Darwin tried to prove his theories.\tHe began writing to breeding experts.\tHe influenced Pavlov.\tHe knew Vaughan Williams.\tHe published further works on the adaptations of plants, including breeds of insectivorous and climbing plants.\tHe then theorized that those which survived would naturally pass on the characteristics essential for survival to their offspring.\tHe was influenced by the work of John Playfair.\tHe was profoundly saddened that in Germany the concept of evolution was being used as an excuse (by Haeckel ) for advocating the elimination of non-German races.\tHis grandfather was potter Josiah Wedgwood.\tHooker became a close friend, and in 1844, Darwin revealed to him his revolutionary idea:  \"\" [ ] I am almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started with) that species are not [ ] immutable\"\".\tIn 1839, Darwin published \"\"Journal of Researches into Geology and Natural History of the various countries visited by HMS Beagle (1831-1836)\"\".\tIn 1856, Darwin began to write his great work on evolution and natural selection.\tIn 1859, \"\"On the Origin of the Species by means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\"\" was published.\tIn scientific circles, it provoked criticism for being too hypothetical and supplying insufficient experimental evidence.\tIn the United States, Gray staunchly defended the theory of natural selection and arranged for the publication of the American edition of the \"\"Origin of the Species\"\".\tIt angered many people for its direct contradiction of the Biblical story of Creation.\tKelvin dismissed the book saying, first, it was self-evident the Earth was designed by a benevolent and intelligent force, and, second, the Earth was not old enough for evolution to have occurred.\tMalthus argued that the population was rising more rapidly than food supplies, and some major catastrophe such as war or a natural disaster would be needed to reduce the numbers.\tMalthus's \"\"Essay on the Principle of Population\"\" (1789) gave Darwin more food for thought when he read it in 1841.\tOne champion was Thomas Huxley , who together with Hooker, defeated the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, in the famous debate on evolution held in 1860 at the British Institution in Oxford.\tOne correspondent was American botanist, Asa Gray, with whom Darwin discussed the distribution of North American flora and fauna.\tOther publications followed, most dealing with the geological aspects of his trip, but Darwin never forgot the \"\"species question\"\".\tSince he was unable to identify most of specimens he collected, he periodically shipped large crates of specimens back to England and also bulletins on his work which were published and made him a highly-respected natural historian.\tThe mission was under the command of FitzRoy, whose cabin Darwin shared.\tThe next year he joined an expedition to South America working as a naturalist for the Royal Navy aboard the \"\"Beagle\"\".\tThe press was quick to publish sensational articles about the \"\"missing link\"\" between humans and apes, and Darwin was often shown as a ridiculous figure.\tThe purpose of the expedition, which lasted for nearly four years, was to survey the east and west coasts of South America, but it also took in the Cape Verde Islands, the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia, Mauritius and South Africa.\tThey agreed that both Darwin's and Wallace's papers should be read before the Linnaean Society.\tThis brought him to the idea that on the islands, one type of finch had evolved into many.\tThough he had presented these ideas in various form since the Beagle returned in 1836, \"\"The Descent of Man\"\" caused  widespread controversy.\tThrough Lyell, Darwin also met libertarian mill-owner Robert Owen .\tTwo years into the work, he received a paper from Wallace , who had ideas so similar to Darwin's that Darwin asked Hooker and Lyell what he should do.",
