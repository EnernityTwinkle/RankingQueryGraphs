seize the throne.\tAfter her release, Elizabeth retired to the country,  to Hatfield,  where she led a life of discretion, obeyed Mary's command to practise official Catholic observance and managed to avoid an arranged marriage with the Catholic Duke of Savoy.\tAlthough only twenty-five years old, she quickly confounded those who thought she could be manipulated for their own ends.\tAt court, she encouraged the cult of herself as Gloriana,  reigning over an entranced nation, and bestowed her favour on a succession of dashing young men.\tAt home, Walsingham's spies unearthed proof that Mary, Queen of Scots was implicated in more plots to assassinate Elizabeth.\tBefore she could retract, her ministers rushed the warrant to Mary's gaolers and Mary was beheaded in February 1587.\tCecil worked behind the scenes for a peaceful accession to the throne by James VI of Scotland after Elizabeth's death.\tCecil's son, Sir Robert Cecil, shrewdly guarded Elizabeth's position and when Essex, her last favourite, attempted an uprising,  the threat was neutralized within a few hours.\tChief among them were Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, Sidney and Raleigh.\tDespite urgings from her ministers, Elizabeth refused to order Mary's execution.\tElizabeth reviewed her troops at Tilbury and delivered an inspiring speech in which she famously declared: \"\"I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king \"\".\tElizabeth was not a fanatic and she did not choose to enquire closely into the private religious habits of her subjects.\tElizabeth was the natural focus for the intrigues of ambitious men and for Protestant uprisings.\tElizabeth was two years old when, by order of her father Henry VIII,  she was declared illegitimate and her mother was executed.\tElizabeth's long reign brought unity to England and established the country as a Protestant power within Europe.\tElizabeth's popularity waned and there were quarrels among her advisers.\tEngland was isolated in Europe and would benefit from an alliance through marriage,  but if the queen married a man from a powerful Catholic state like France or Spain, both England's independence and newly established religion would be compromised.\tFrom the continent, information of Catholic plots to invade England were relayed by trusty informants such as Thomas Bodley.\tHer doctor was William Gilbert.\tHer first and probably most important political act was to appoint William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) as her principal secretary of state.\tHer single status, and the wish of her supporters for an heir to the throne was a card she played skilfully.\tHer situation became even more dangerous when Edward died in 1553 and Mary I became Queen.\tIf Elizabeth married a Protestant,  like the king of Sweden, she risked antagonising both France and Spain who were militarily much stronger than England.\tIn 1569 there was a serious Catholic uprising in the north of England, and in 1571 the Ridolfi plot to assassinate Elizabeth for Mary was discovered through the work of Walsingham's international spy network.\tIn 1585 Elizabeth was reluctantly drawn into military involvement on the continent in support of the Protestants.\tIn 1588 Philip II of Spain sent the Armada to invade Britain.\tIn a famous victory, the Spanish fleet was defeated in the English Channel and England was saved from invasion.\tIn the last decade of her reign, a series of bad harvests and high inflation brought hardship to many.\tIn the year following her accession she established the Protestant religion in England by Act of Parliament and she herself became supreme governor of the church.\tIt was generally recognised that Elizabeth loved Robert Dudley, and she certainly  favored him above all others in the early years of her reign, but rumors about his wife's death ended his hopes of marriage to the queen.\tMary died in November 1558 and Elizabeth came to the throne.\tMary was a Roman Catholic who made an unpopular marriage to Philip II of Spain and was determined to stamp out Protestantism in England.\tMary was seen by dissident nobles and rebellious English Catholics as an alternative monarch.\tMost important of all, she had learned to keep her own counsel and act carefully.\tShe agreed to send a small force to fight against Spanish troops in the Netherlands.\tShe and her government adopted a cautious policy of restoring Protestantism in the country, substituting fines for the imprisonments and burnings at the stake previously used by Mary in the service of Catholicism.\tShe banned Knox.\tShe consulted Thomas Allen.\tShe knew the work of Burbage and Shakespeare.\tShe never again came near to marrying,  although she often pretended to consider marriage, either as a diplomatic ploy or to placate Parliament, on whom the monarchy relied for funds.\tShe received an excellent classical education from a group of distinguished humanist scholars, and as a girl she became familiar with the ideals of the Protestant Reformation.\tShe refused to name her successor until allegedly indicating it should be James just before she died.\tShe sent Dudley on an expedition.\tShe sent troops to aid Prince Maurice of Nassau Scaliger was impressed by her languages.\tShe was arrested in 1554 and spent three months in the Tower of London, expecting to share the fate of her mother.\tShe was astute, charismatic and articulate.\tThe concern about Elizabeth dying childless centred on the fact that her heir would be Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic.\tThe popular choice would be an English aristocrat,  but that would cause jealousy among the great noble families, perhaps to the point of civil war.\tThe queen acted leniently to Essex's young followers, like de la Warr,  but Essex was executed.\tThe same year she approved an expedition by Sir Francis Drake to attack Spanish possessions in the New World.\tThis time, after much agonizing, Elizabeth gave in and signed Mary's death warrant.\tWhen the young Edward VI succeeded to the throne in 1547, Elizabeth moved to Chelsea under the care of Henry VIII's widow, Catherine Parr, who had now married Thomas Seymour, the Lord High Admiral.\tWith a real talent for languages, she learned Greek, Latin, French and Italian.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg":
