He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest -- a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\tA hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.\tA hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.\tA knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms\u2014it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.\tA man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.\tA person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.\tA photograph never grows old. You and I change, people change all through the months and years, but a photograph always remains the same. How nice to look at a photograph of mother or father taken many years ago. You see them as you remember them. But as people live on, they change completely. That is why I think a photograph can be kind.\tA theory is the more impressive the greater is the simplicity of its premises, the more different are the kinds of things it relates and the more extended the range of its applicability.\tAccording to this conception, the sole function of education was to open the way to thinking and knowing, and the school, as the outstanding organ for the people's education, must serve that end exclusively.\tAll meaningful and lasting change starts first in your imagination and then works its way out. Imagination is more important than knowledge.\tAll such action would cease if those powerful elemental forces were to cease stirring within us.\tAll that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual.\tAll these constructions and the laws connecting them can be arrived at by the principle of looking for the mathematically simplest concepts and the link between them.\tAll these primary impulses, not easily described in words, are the springs of man's actions.\tAn attempt at visualizing the Fourth Dimension: Take a point, stretch it into a line, curl it into a circle, twist it into a sphere, and punch through the sphere.\tAn empty stomach is not a good political advisor.\tAnd the high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule, or to impose himself in any other way.\tAnyone who doesn't take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.\tAs far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\tAt the same time, as social beings, we are moved in the relations with our fellow beings by such feelings as sympathy, pride, hate, need for power, pity, and so on.\tBut their intervention makes our acts to serve ever less merely the immediate claims of our instincts.\tCommon sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.\tConfusion of goals and perfection of means seems, in my opinion, to characterize our age.\tConsidered logically this concept is not identical with the totality of sense impressions referred to; but it is an arbitrary creation of the human (or animal) mind.\tCreating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and erecting a skyscraper in its place. It is rather like climbing a mountain, gaining new and wider views, discovering unexpected connections between our starting points and its rich environment. But the point from which we started out still exists and can be seen, although it appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad view gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous way up.\tDuring the last century, and part of the one before, it was widely held that there was an unreconcilable conflict between knowledge and belief.\tEach makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life, in order to find in this way peace and security which he can not find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience.\tEach of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.\tEducation is the progressive realization of our ignorance.\tEducation is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.\tEvery kind of peaceful cooperation among men is primarily based on mutual trust and only secondarily on institutions such as courts of justice and police.\tEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\tFew are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.\tFew people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.\tFormal symbolic representation of qualitative entities is doomed to its rightful place of minor significance in a world where flowers and beautiful women abound.\tGod always takes the simplest way.\tGod does not play dice with the universe.\tGod is clever, but not dishonest.\tGod is subtle, but He is not malicious. I cannot believe that God plays dice with the world.\tGravitation can not be held responsible for people falling in love\tGravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love.\tGreat spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.\tGreat spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices, but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.\tHe who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead; his eyes are closed.\tHe who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would fully suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action! It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder.\tHow do I work? I grope.\tHow strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.\tHunger, love, pain, fear are some of those inner forces which rule the individual's instinct for self preservation.\tI believe that the first step in the setting of a real external world is the formation of the concept of bodily objects and of bodily objects of various kinds.\tI can't believe that God plays dice with the universe.\tI do not know with what weapons World War 3 will be fought, but World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones.\tI have little patience with scientists who take a board of wood, look for its thinnest part, and drill a great number of holes where drilling is easy.\tI have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.\tI know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent; curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism have brought me to my ideas.\tI live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity.\tI never think of the future. It comes soon enough.\tI think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right.\tIf A equals success, then the formula is A equals X plus Y and Z, with X being work, Y play, and Z keeping your mouth shut.\tIf men as individuals surrender to the call of their elementary instincts, avoiding pain and seeking satisfaction only for their own selves, the result for them all taken together must be a state of insecurity, of fear, and of promiscuous misery.\tIf my theory of relativity is proven successful, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.\tIf one asks the whence derives the authority of fundamental ends, since they cannot be stated and justified merely by reason, one can only answer: they exist in a healthy society as powerful traditions, which act upon the conduct and aspirations and judgments of the individuals; they are there, that is, as something living, without its being necessary to find justification for their existence.\tIf one were to take that goal out of out of its religious form and look merely at its purely human side, one might state it perhaps thus: free and responsible development of the individual, so that he may place his powers freely and gladly in the service of all mankind.\tIf the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.\tIf we knew what we were doing it wouldn't be research.\tIf you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.\tImagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\tImagination is more important than knowledge.\tImagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.\tIn a healthy nation there is a kind of dramatic balance between the will of the people and the government, which prevents its degeneration into tyranny.\tIn matters of truth and justice, there is no difference between large and small problems, for issues concerning the treatment of people are all the same.\tIn that way imagination and intelligence enter into our existence in the part of servants of the primary instincts.\tIn the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.\tIntellectuals solve problems; geniuses prevent them.\tIt gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubbornness of an incorrigible nonconformist warmly acclaimed.\tIt is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.\tIt is a very high goal which, with our weak powers, we can reach only very inadequately, but which gives a sure foundation to our aspirations and valuations.\tIt is not enough that you should understand about applied science in order that your work may increase mans blessings. Concern for the man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors; concern for the great unsolved problems of the organization of labor and the distribution of goods in order that the creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.\tIt is only to the individual that a soul is given.\tIt is our American habit if we find the foundations of our educational structure unsatisfactory to add another story or wing. We find it easier to add a new study or course or kind of school than to recognize existing conditions so as to meet the need. strangled the holy curious of inquiry. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.\tIt is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.\tIt is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.\tIt is theory that decides what can be observed.\tIt should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.\tIt stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man's insecurity before himself and before nature.\tIt's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.\tKeep on sowing your seed, for you never know which will grow -- perhaps it all will.\tKnowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be.\tLet every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized.\tLove is a better teacher than duty.\tMan tries to make for himself in the fashion that suits him best a simplified and intelligible picture of the world; he then tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his for the world of experience, and thus to overcome it.\tMany of the things you can count, don't count. Many of the things you can't count, really count.\tMany times a day I realize how much my own life is built on the labors of my fellowmen, and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received.\tMost of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone.\tMy religion consists of a humble admiration of the unlimitable superior who reveals Himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.\tNever do anything against conscience even if the state demands it.\tNever lose a holy curiosity.\tNever memorize what you can look up in books\tNot everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.\tNothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.\tNothing that I can do will change the structure of the universe. But maybe, by raising my voice I can help the greatest of all causes -- goodwill among men and peace on earth.\tNothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet\tOccurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature.\tOn the other hand, the concept owes its meaning and its justification exclusively to the totality of the sense impressions which we associate with it.\tOne must not attempt to justify them, but rather to sense their nature simply and clearly.\tOne need only think of the weather, in which case the prediction even for a few days ahead is impossible.\tOne strength of the communist system of the East is that it has some of the character of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion.\tOnly a life lived in the service to others is worth living.\tOnly one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.\tOnly two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.\tOut of the multitude of our sense experiences we take, mentally and arbitrarily, certain repeatedly occurring complexes of sense impression (partly in conjunction with sense impressions which are interpreted as signs for sense experiences of others), and we attribute to them a meaning the meaning of the bodily object.\tPerfection of means and confusion of goals seem -- in my opinion -- to characterize our age.\tPolitics is far more complicated than physics.\tPossessions, outward success, publicity, luxury -- to me these have always been contemptible. I assume that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best for both the body and the mind\tProblems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.\tReality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.\tScience can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary.\tScience is the attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our sense experience correspond to a logically uniform system of thought.\tScience is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thorough-going an association as possible.\tScience without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\tSolitude is painful when one is young, but delightful when one is more mature.\tSome recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivablethough much less certainthat extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat or exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.\tSometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.\tTechnological progress is like an ax in the hands of a pathological criminal.\tThe American lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European. Life for him is always becoming, never being.\tThe attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while.\tThe bitter and the sweet come from the outside, the hard from within, from one's own efforts.\tThe difference between what the most and the least learned people know is inexpressibly trivial in relation to that which is unknown.\tThe distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\tThe distinctions separating the social classes are false; in the last analysis they rest on force.\tThe environment is everything that isn't me.\tThe fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears, for there's no risk of accident for someone who's dead.\tThe formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.\tThe grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.\tThe hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.\tThe high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule...\tThe highest principles for our aspirations and judgments are given to us in the Jewish-Christian religious tradition.\tThe ideals which have always shone before me and filled me with the joy of living are goodness, beauty, and truth.\tThe ideas that have lighted my way and, time after time, have given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth.\tThe important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery everyday. Never lose a holy  curiosity.\tThe legs are the wheels of creativity.\tThe man of science is a poor philosopher.\tThe most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious. It is the power of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms -- this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the rank of devoutly religious men.\tThe most evident difference springs from the important part which is played in man by a relatively strong power of imagination and by the capacity to think, aided as it is by language and other symbolically devices.\tThe most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life.\tThe most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.\tThe only real valuable thing is intuition.\tThe only source of knowledge is experience.\tThe only way to escape the personal corruption of praise is to go on working.\tThe opinion prevailed among advanced minds that it was time that belief should be replaced increasingly by knowledge; belief that did not itself rest on knowledge was superstition, and as such had to be opposed.\tThe person who reads too much and uses his brain too little will fall into lazy habits of thinking.\tThe pioneers of a warless world are the young men and women who refuse military service.\tThe pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.\tThe real difficulty, the difficulty which has baffled the sages of all times, is rather this: how can we make our teaching so potent in the motional life of man, that its influence should withstand the pressure of the elemental psychic forces in the individual?\tThe secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.\tThe significant problems we face today cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.\tThe true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.\tThe unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.\tThe whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.\tThe words of language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought.

to the United States in 1921, around the world in 1922-23, to South America in 1925 - lecturing on physics and raising money for the Zionist cause.\tAs his reputation grew, Einstein was then appointed as full professor at the German University of Prague in 1911, and then at the Federal Technical Institute at Zurich in 1912.\tBelieving in a God and an exactly engineered universe, at the Solvay Conference of 1927 on quantum theory attended by Planck, Bohr, de Broglie, Heisenberg, Schrodinger and Dirac among others - Einstein alienated many of his  colleagues by claiming that quantum mechanics, which could only calculate the probabilities of physical events, although brilliant could not be absolutely correct because \"\"God does not play dice\"\" with the universe.\tDespite these achievements, when Einstein submitted his paper on relativity to the University of Berne in 1905 in support of his application to become a Privatdozent (unsalaried junior lecturer), his application was rejected and he continued at the Patent Office for another three years.\tDuring the 1920s he returned to the quantum theory, when in 1923 Louis de Broglie used Einstein's mass-energy equation and Planck's quantum theory to achieve an expression describing the wave nature of a particle.\tDuring the 1920s, a period when Germany's political situation was deteriorating rapidly and anti-Semitism was on the rise, he instead became involved in anti-nationalist and pacifist causes, and began publicly to support the Zionist movement - all of which made him highly unpopular with Germany's growing right wing.\tDuring the war years, Einstein became an outspoken opponent of German militarism, but remained primarily engaged in perfecting the extension of his 1905 theory of relativity to a broader context, by considering systems that are not in uniform motion but under acceleration.\tEinstein hypothesized that the visible motion of the particles was caused by the random movement of molecules that made up the liquid, and derived a mathematical formula that predicted the distance travelled by particles and their relative speed, from which the number of molecules of liquid per unit volume could be inferred.\tEinstein instead postulated that gravitation is not a force, as Newton had believed, but a curved field in the space-time continuum, created by the presence of mass, replacing Newton's theory of gravitational attraction between bodies by a space-time mathematical description in which bodies influence the characteristics of space in their vicinity.\tEinstein was triumphantly vindicated when observations of a solar eclipse in 1919 showed apparent shifts of exactly the amount he had predicted, and once this result was reported throughout the world Einstein became internationally famous, and relativity a household word.\tEinstein's conclusions regarding time dilation and mass increase were later verified with observations of fast-moving subatomic particles and cosmic rays, and no velocity greater than the speed of light has ever been detected.\tEinstein's hypothesis and accompanying mathematical formula, which has become known as Einstein's photoelectric law, were confirmed by several experiments, laid the practical foundation for the fields of quantum physics and quantitative photoelectric chemistry, and got him the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics.\tEinstein's publication of his \"\"Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\"\" essentially brought to a close the revolutionary period of his scientific career.\tEinstein's second paper (\"\"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\"\") dealt with the photoelectric effect.\tEinstein's support for de Broglie inspired Schrodinger to establish wave mechanics, but the development of this system into one involving indeterminancy greatly disturbed Einstein.\tEinstein's theory was revolutionary because previously scientists had believed that basic quantities of measurement such as time, mass, and length were absolute and unchanging, while his work established the opposite notion - that these measurements could change, depending on the relative motion of the observer.\tEinstein's work on Brownian motion is generally regarded as the first direct experimental evidence for the hypothesis that matter is composed of atoms and molecules.\tFirst observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888, the photoelectric effect involves the release of electrons from a metal that occurs when light is shone on the metal, the number of electrons released being a function not of the light's intensity (as one might expect) but of the color (i.e. the wavelength) of the light.\tHe also found that in a system in motion relative to an observer,  not only would length be observed to decrease, but time would slow and mass would increase.\tHe discovered the basic laser principle He was a friend of Lindemann.\tHe influenced Heaviside, and Wiener.\tHe knew Rutherford.\tHe met Eisenstein.\tHe met composer Britten.\tHe spent only a year teaching there, however, before he was appointed, in 1909, as junior professor of  physics at the University of Zurich.\tHe then extended these ideas into a general theory published as: \"\"The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\"\" in 1916.\tHe was influenced by Helmholtz.\tHe was painted by Rothenstein.\tHis work related to that of Lenard.\tIf a system were to move at the velocity of light, to an observer its length would be zero, time would be at a stop, and its mass would be infinite.\tIn 1895 Einstein failed the  entrance examination for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  in Zurich, one of Europe's finest institutions for higher learning in science, where he had planned to major in electrical engineering.\tIn 1896, Einstein entered the FIT as a student of general science but often failed to attend his classes,  spending much of his time to reading on his own, in particular the works of Kirchhoff, Hertz, Maxwell, Mach and the works on geometry of the mathematician Riemann.\tIn 1900 he graduated but was unable to find a regular teaching job and instead supported himself as a tutor in a private school in Schaffhausen.\tIn 1901 he became a Swiss citizen, and published his first scientific paper: \"\"Consequences of Capillary Phenomena\"\".\tIn 1902, Einstein got a junior-level appointment at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, working as an appraiser for new electrical machines,  and studying in his spare time for a doctorate from the University of Zurich,  which he achieved in 1905 for a paper titled:  \"\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"\".\tIn 1908 his second application to Berne was accepted.\tIn 1913, Einstein was made director of scientific research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin and given a chair in physics  at the University of Berlin, where he became the colleague of, among others, Planck, Nernst, and later Schrodinger.\tIn 1939 he was informed by Niels Bohr that at Copenhagen the German refugee physicist Lise Meitner had split the uranium atom in experiments that had been inspired by similar, though less precise, experiments done months earlier in Berlin by two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.\tIn 1952, after the death of Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, Einstein was invited to succeed him as president, but he declined as having a personality unsuited to politics.\tIn addition to his continued work on the unified field theory, he was continually in demand as a speaker and during the 1930s he wrote extensively on many topics, especially peace.\tIn addition to these three great achievements, Einstein wrote two more papers in 1905, one being his doctoral dissertation, and the other titled: \"\"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?\"\" which again dealt with relativity and came to the conclusion that the energy and mass of a body are closely interrelated.\tIn order to extend the special theory, he investigated the effect of gravitation on light, and in 1911 concluded that light rays would be bent in a gravitational field.\tIn order to solve this problem, Einstein - using the quantum hypothesis (1900) of the German physicist Planck - postulated that light travels in tiny discrete bundles, or individual \"\"quanta\"\" of energy (later called photons), the energy of which is a function of its wavelength.\tIn particular, he found it impossible to accept Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, central to quantum mechanics, which states that the movement of a single particle could not be predicted because of a fundamental uncertainty in measuring simultaneously both its speed and its position (which meant, in effect, that the future of any physical system at the subatomic level cannot be predicted).\tIn this work, Einstein showed that Newton's theory of gravitation is in fact a close approximation of his more exact general theory of relativity, but relegated it to a special case, only useful at relatively slow speeds.\tInstead, much to the dismay of the majority of his fellow scientists (in particular his close friend the German quantum theorist Born), Einstein devoted the remaining years of his life to the search for a unified field theory, a single mathematical theory that would encompass all physical fields, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism.\tIt had also proved impossible to measure the expected changes in the speed of light relative to the motion of the Earth, and in 1881 and 1887 the Michelson-Morley experiment had proved conclusively there was no 'ether,'  and  that the velocity of light does not vary with the motion of either the source or the observer.\tNow attempting to encompass all kinds of motion and accelerations (varying velocities), Einstein introduced the concept that it is not possible to distinguish being in a uniform gravitational field from moving under constant acceleration without gravitation and that therefore, in a general view of relativity, gravitation must be taken into account.\tOne of his early followers was Laue.\tOne of the greatest scientists in history.\tOwing to the apparent imminence of war, Einstein was persuaded by colleagues to write a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt urging that research be funded for an atomic bomb on the grounds that the United States had to possess the weapon before Germany.\tSo when light falls on a metal, electrons in the metal absorb specific quanta of energy, giving them enough energy to escape from the surface of the metal,  with the number of electrons released determined not by the number of quanta (i.e. the intensity) of the light, but by its energy (i.e. its wavelength).\tThe first of these (\"\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"\") dealt with a phenomenon first observed by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827, who reported that tiny particles, such as pollen grains, moved about with a rapid and random zigzag motion when suspended in liquid, and that the motion of the particles increased when the temperature increased, but that the motion decreased if larger particles were used.\tThe first was the explanation of an anomaly in the orbit of the planet Mercury (that its perihelion, or point of orbit closest to the Sun, advanced slightly more than was predicted by Newton's laws) that could not be explained by Newtonian mechanics.\tThe magnitude of these effects is negligible at ordinary velocities, for which Newton's laws still held good, but at velocities approaching the speed of light they become significant.\tThe same year,  in 'The Annals of Physics'  Einstein published three papers (on Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, and special relativity) that not only established his genius as a theoretical physicist, but also changed both the face of physics and humanity's view of the universe.\tThe second was that a red shift (i.e. to a longer wavelength) is produced if light passes through an intense gravitational field (this was subsequently detected in astronomical observations by the English astronomer Arthur Eddington in 1924).\tThe third test was Einstein's prediction that the apparent positions of stars would shift when they are seen near the Sun, because the Sun's intense gravity would bend the light rays from the stars as they pass the Sun (this starlight being visible only during a total eclipse).\tThe third, and most revolutionary paper of 1905 (\"\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\"\"), which discussed the relationship between measurements made by observers in two separate systems moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, contained the idea which was to make Einstein famous, his special theory of relativity.\tThis recommendation marked the beginning of the Manhattan Project for the construction of the world's first nuclear weapons, although it was such scientists as Fermi rather than Einstein himself (considered a security risk, in spite of  becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940) who led and participated in the project.\tTo account for  this, the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald, and the Dutch physicist Lorentz independently suggested that all lengths (of the stands,  for example,  holding the mirrors reflecting the light beam whose velocity through the 'ether' was being measured) contract in the direction of motion (the 'FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction'),  and had developed a mathematical formula to  describe the effect of motion on various types of measurement.\tTwo years later, in 1907, he went on to show that mass is related to energy by the famous equation E=mc2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared), which indicates the enormous amount of energy that is stored as mass, some of which is released in radioactivity and nuclear reactions.\tUp to this time, there had been a steady accumulation of knowledge which suggested that light and other electromagnetic radiation does not behave as predicted by classical physics (e.g. no method had been found to calculate the velocity of light in a single direction, as all the known methods involved a reflection of light rays back along their original path).\tWas nearly anticipated by Langevin.\tWith the rise of National Socialism in Germany, Einstein's position as both a Jew and a pacifist became increasingly difficult, and with Hitler's rise to power in 1933 he accepted an appointment at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey, where he spent the rest of his life.\tWrote anti-war letter with Russell.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0jcx", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
