Edgar Thomson (the president of  the Pennsylvania Railroad) financed a sleeping-car company, established by Theodore Woodruff.\tHe combined a blend of traditional ownership with modern management techniques which relied on accurate business calculations and strict economy.\tHe had earlier, in 1881, given a library and swimming pool to the town of Dunfermline, Scotland.\tHe had instructed Frick not to renew contracts unless the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers disbanded.\tHe obliged his partners to be active managers and profit was ploughed back into the company.\tHe used Bessemer's steel-making process He hired Fessenden.\tHe was promoted to part-time telegrapher, and, at 16, became a full-time operator.\tHe worked with CM Schwab, whom he sent to visit Krupp.\tHis grandmother was Rennie's sister He knew Gary and Mellon.\tHis work related to that of Eads and Bessemer.\tIn 1848, on borrowed money, the family set sail for the United States.\tIn 1872, at 37, Carnegie struck it even more rich.\tIn Pittsburgh, the 13-year-old Carnegie was taken on by another Scot, John Jay, as a bobbin boy in a cotton mill, with occasional stints in the office, where he learned the rudiments of bookkeeping and management and took a business course at night.\tIn the 1890s, after the American steel market became flooded by overproduction, Carnegie opposed the pooling of assets and refused association with any of the holding companies that sought to stabilize prices.\tScott hired Carnegie as his personal telegrapher and secretary in 1852, when Carnegie was 17.\tTension grew and a fight called the Battle of the Monongahela River broke out in the summer.\tThe deal was almost risk-free since Thomson would make sure Woodruff's company got Pennsylvania RR business.\tThe industrial revolution sweeping Scotland destroyed Carnegie's father's livelihood as weaver.\tThe rest he would invest in good causes.\tThe shares they were given, though fractional, were worth huge amounts of money.\tThe two struck a deal.\tThese were vast sums at the time.\tThey did not, so their jobs were given to others.\tThis policy brought Frick, an owner of coalfields and a coke producer, into the company in 1881.\tThrough the years, Carnegie gave out partnerships to his best employees.\tTo invest in a new steel mill to produce railroad sleepers, he liquidated his assets.\tTwice, in 1897 and 1899, financier J. P. Morgan and collaborators tried to lure him into pooling trusts, but he resisted.\tWhen the American Tinplate and other trusts stopped ordering from Carnegie Steel, he diversified into tin products: hoop, rod, wire, nails etc., confident that his super-efficient production methods would outride the competition.\tWith the ability to take down Morse code by ear, instead of having to transcribe it from tape, Carnegie caught the eye of Thomas  A.
