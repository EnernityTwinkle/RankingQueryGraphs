Tippit.\tAt 1.45 pm he was then seen entering a movie theatre, where he was arrested.\tAt Dallas police headquarters, Oswald denied any part in the assassination of Kennedy or the murder of Tippit.\tBorn after his father died, Oswald, along with his brother, spent his early years mainly in orphanages.\tHe and his wife became friendly with George and Jeanne De Morenschildt, a couple with strong connections to U.S. intelligence services.\tHe continued to visit his wife and children at their home in Irving, TX. On November 21, 1963, Oswald again visited his family, saying he had come to get curtain rods for his new room in Dallas.\tHe rented a room and got a job as an order-filler at the Texas School Book Depository.\tHe spent one day with her, then left for Europe.\tHe was also active in the local squadron of the Civil Air Patrol.\tHe was also seen on the first floor of the depository about 10 minutes before President Kennedy was shot as he drove in an open car at 12.30 pm.\tHe was considered moody and nervous, but did well in intelligence tests and was sent to join a marine air radar unit in Japan.\tHe worked for a time at a photographic company.\tHis \"\"Historic Diary\"\" is believed to be a fake because it is full of spelling and grammatical mistakes that were not typical of Oswald.\tHowever, two witnesses saw Oswald on the second-floor fewer than two minutes after the assassination.\tIn April, he moved to New Orleans and took a job with a coffee company.\tIn March, 1961, he married Marina Prusakova, the niece of a colonel in the KGB, the Russian secret police.\tIn March, 1963, Oswald bought a rifle by mail.\tIn September, 1964, the Warren commission concluded that Oswald was solely responsible for the assassination, the wounding of Texas governor, John B. Connally, who had been in the car with Kennedy, and the murder of Tippit.\tIn September, he went to Mexico City, where he visited both the Soviet and Cuban embassies.\tIt is known he lived in Minsk and worked at an electronics plant, but there is no other record of his time in Russia.\tNo individual or group claimed responsibility for the assassination.\tOn November 22, he was seen by a fellow worker at the depository carrying a package wrapped in brown paper.\tOne witness saw shots coming from the sixth floor, and later identified Oswald as the gunman.\tOswald became interested in the writings of Karl Marx in high school.\tOswald learned Russian and sometimes disappeared from the unit, leading to speculation he was working for the CIA. In 1959, at 20, Oswald got a discharge from the marines, pleading he had to look after his sick mother.\tOswald left Russia in June, 1962, flying to Fort Worth with his wife and child.\tOswald was taken to hospital where he died in the operating room.\tOswald's rifle, together with cartridge cases, was found on the sixth floor of the depository.\tOutwardly, he gave the impression of being a Marxist who supported Castro in Cuba, but all his known contacts were with hard line anti-Communists.\tPresident Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren to lead an inquiry into the assassination and the killing of Oswald.\tShortly after they arrived, Oswald was sent to a New York youth house for six months for repeated truancy.\tThe unit was housed in an area where the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was working on material brought in by the U-2 spy plane.\tTwo days later, as he was being transferred to the Dallas county jail, he was shot in the stomach by Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, who had been in the crowd.\tWhen he was 15, his mother moved the family back to New Orleans.\tWhen he was 17, his mother moved the family back to Fort Worth, where Oswald joined the marines.\tWhen he was six, his mother (who worked as a telephone operator and sales clerk) remarried, and moved to Fort Worth, TX, with her husband, taking her boys with her.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.04gwy", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
