Fitzgerald sing them\"\".\tAfter the success of the Verve songbooks, Fitzgerald turned the management of her career over to Granz.\tAlthough she began recording in 1935 and won her first Down Beat Magazine award for \"\"Most Popular Girl Vocalist\"\" in 1937, Fitzgerald's first major hit did not come until 1939, when she recorded \"\"A Tisket, A Tasket\"\" for Decca.\tAugust 1956 also saw the first of her highly successful recordings with her friend Louis Armstrong: the album Ella and Louis, with Oscar Peterson, Buddy Rich, Herb Ellis, and Ray Brown.\tBy the time of her death in 1996 at age 78, Fitzgerald had become one of the best-known and admired singers in the world.\tElla Fitzgerald is recognized alongside Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan as one of the greatest female singers in the history of jazz.\tElla Fitzgerald was born in 1918 in Newport News, VA.\tElla also began touring worldwide in 1948 with Norman Granz's support.\tElla appeared frequently at jazz festivals with the great musicians of the day, including Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, and Oscar Peterson.\tElla made both commercial and jazz records, taking a major step in 1946 when she began her association with Norman Granz's \"\"Jazz at the Philharmonic\"\".\tElla recorded nearly 300 songs for the Verve songbooks.\tElla was one of the honorary pallbearers at Armstrong's funeral in 1971, along with Crosby, Pearl Bailey, Johnny Carson, and Dizzy Gillespie.\tFitzgerald severed her ties to Decca in 1956 and signed with Granz's new Verve label.\tHer demand for equal pay with white artists would have an important effect on many musicians who came after her.\tHer early projects for Verve included some of her most important and influential recordings, a series of \"\"songbooks\"\" dedicated to major American songwriters such as Cole Porter (1956), Duke Ellington (1956- 1957), and George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin (1959).\tHer performance also won first prize at the Apollo,  and caught the attention of a member of Chick Webb's band, who insisted that his bandleader listen to Ella sing.\tHer performances with bop musicians emphasized her talents as a scat singer.\tHer rendition of \"\"The Object of My Affection\"\" won first prize and inspired her to enter the amateur contest at the Apollo Theatre.\tHer virtuosity as a jazz musician rivaled the best instrumentalists, but she was equally influential as a singer of pop songs.\tIn 1947 Dizzy Gillespie booked her for a six-week tour with his band, during which she blossomed as a bebop singer and met her future husband, bass player Ray Brown.\tIn the 1940s, Fitzgerald decided to concentrate on her solo career and the band members went their separate ways.\tIt was a major hit, and the duo later recorded Ella and Louis Again and Porgy and Bess, in addition to their performances together.\tIt was followed by a number of popular singles, including \"\"Undecided,\"\" which helped earn her the nickname \"\"The First Lady of Song\"\".\tShe continued to release both pop and jazz records, and Granz encouraged her to record her concerts as well.\tShe had remarkable range and agility, and was known for her ability to imitate other singers as well as instrumental sounds.\tShe led the group for two years, adding Dizzy Gillespie to her trumpet section for a tour in 1940.\tShe sang with Brown's group from 1948-1952.\tShe spent her childhood in Yonkers,  NY with her mother and stepfather, where she was introduced to music at an early age.\tShe studied piano when the family had money to spare for her lessons, and enjoyed singing along to pop songs on the radio with her mother.\tShe was also the first woman and the first pop singer to receive the prestigious Lincoln Center Medallion.\tShe was granted a several honorary degrees and won numerous awards throughout her career, including the Kennedy Center Honor (1979), the National Medal of Arts (1987), France's Commander of Arts and Letters (1990) and fourteen Grammy Awards.\tShe was still a minor and homeless, so Webb and his wife became her legal guardians.\tThe series was extremely successful, attracting a wide audience and establishing her as a major interpreter of popular songs.\tThe song, now enshrined in the Grammy Hall of Fame, made her a swing-era celebrity.\tThis gave her the opportunity to improvise with progressive jazz artists such as Charlie Parker and Lester Young, and introduced her to an international audience.\tUnder his guidance, Ella learned to sing with a big band and quickly became the Savoy's star attraction.\tWebb, whose band played at the legendary Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, was so impressed with her voice that he hired her in 1935.\tWhen Chick Webb died in 1939, Ella took over direction of his band.\tWhen her mother died, fifteen-year-old Ella lived briefly with her aunt in Harlem before her excessive truancy caused her to be placed in an orphanage.", "answer_type": "",
