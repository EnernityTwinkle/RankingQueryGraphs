For the home trip, instead of turning before the west winds around Cape Horn, Cook crossed the Tasman Sea westward and on April 19, 1770, came upon the southeast coast of Australia.\tHe began to organize a more ambitious voyage.\tHe called at the Cape of Good Hope and New Zealand, and, because of contrary winds, spent some months at Tonga and Tahiti before reaching the North American coast in March, 1778, discovering Hawaii on the way.\tHe charted Easter Island, Tonga, the Marquesas, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, part of Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic.\tHe finally reached England in July, 1771.\tHe met French naturalist Daubenton Jenner catalogued specimens from his  first voyage John Montagu helped to ensure his ships were well- provisioned.\tHe reached latitude 71 10' South.\tHe returned to Hawaii to wait out the winter,  but in February, 1779, was killed on a Hawaiian beach while trying to recover a ship's boat  which had been taken by a native.\tHe spent the following year in England writing an account of his second voyage and preparing for his third.\tHe studied navigation in Halifax under military surveyor Hollandt and  Desbarres,  for whom he made precise surveys and charts of the reaches of the St. Lawrence River and of the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador.\tHe traced the North American coast into the Bering Sea and then through the Bering Strait until he was stopped by vast ice fields at 70 10\"\" North.\tHe was promoted to captain, elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and awarded one of its highest honors, the gold Copley Medal, for his 1776 paper on scurvy.\tHe was promoted to commander and presented to King George III.\tHis exceptional work in Canada did not go unnoticed in the Admiralty, and in 1768, at 40, he was named commander of HMS \"\"Endeavour\"\", whose mission, organized by the Royal Society, was to carry scientists to the South Pacific to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun on June 3, 1769.\tHis intent was to find either a northwest passage around Canada and Alaska, or a northeast one around Siberia, between the Atlantic and Pacific.\tIn 1757, two years after he joined up, Cook was made master of HMS \"\"Pembroke\"\".\tIn 1766, he sent his observation of an eclipse of the sun to the Royal Society in London.\tIn July, 1776, once again aboard the \"\"Resolution\"\", Cook set out in the company of the \"\"Discovery\"\".\tMade an immeasurable contribution to knowledge of the Pacific Ocean, in terms of geography, natural history, and ethnology.\tThat same year, he was transferred to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he served for 11 years.\tUsing John Harrison's chronometer (he was the first major navigator to do so) Cook sailed south from the Cape of Good Hope, then east, circumnavigating the globe.\tWith two ships, the \"\"Resolution\"\" and \"\"Adventure\"\", he set out in July, 1772 with a staff of astronomers, naturalists, and artists, including Johann Reinhold Forster and his Forster's son Georg Forster, (who had replaced Joseph Priestley, excluded because of his unorthodox religious views.)
