specimens of fire-damp, the explosive gas now known as methane which was prevalent in mines.\tBeddoes, who was eager to see if the pneumatic gases were of use in medicine,  appointed Davy as chemical superintendent of the Institute and set him up in a laboratory.\tBefore setting out on his honeymoon in Scotland Davy finished his \"\"Elements of Chemical Philosophy,\"\" eagerly seized upon by the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley among others.\tConversely, the lamps burned more brightly when there was a danger of explosion, so they also acted as detectors.\tDavy entered into a correspondence with the physician and chemist Dr Thomas Beddoes, who established the Pneumatic Medical Institution in Clifton, near Bristol.\tDavy examined the substance in his portable laboratory at his Paris hotel, named it iodine and published an account of its properties, greatly offending Gay-Lussac.\tDavy had permission from Napoleon to travel in France and in Paris he associated with the leading French scientific men, including Gay-Lussac who had just given the name iode to a substance discovered by Courtois the previous year.\tDavy is remembered most of all for the miners' lamp he invented and for the discovery of sodium and potassium.\tDavy refused to patent his invention, declaring that it was for the benefit of mankind.\tDavy's contacts and his wide range of interests made him an excellent promoter of science.\tFor his invention, Davy was awarded medals by the Royal Society and given a service of plate by the northern mine owners.\tFrom 1813-15, Davy and  his wife travelled on the continent accompanied by Faraday.\tHe also made observations on Vesuvius.\tHe discovered that the gas did not penetrate through very small openings and worked out the exact size of aperture which stopped the gas.\tHe experimented with the voltaic pile decided that it was a chemical action which caused the production of electricity in electrolytic cells, and that the chemical interaction occurred between substances which had an opposite charge.\tHe further stated that electrolysis was possibly the most successful method for  restructuring all substances to isolate their elements.\tHe never lost his interest in geology.\tHe then proceeded to isolate the alkaline-earth metals (following a method described to him in a letter from the Swedish scientist Berzelius) and also to discover boron, hydrogen telluride and hydrogen phosphide.\tHe was a friend the geologist Ure, and it was due to Davy that Murchison took up geology.\tHe was also made a baronet.\tHe was the most prominent scientist of his time and did a great deal to promote the usefulness of science in commerce and industry, and to popularise the achievements of science.\tHe was wounded in the eye during the course of his experiments and was afterwards assisted by Faraday.\tHis continued to pursue his own researches and for the Navy Board he investigated ways of preventing corrosion of the copper sheathing on ships' bottoms.\tHis first course of lectures were on galvanism, after which he was commissioned to conduct an investigation into the process of tanning.\tHis last lecture was \"\"On the Relation of Electrical and Chemical Charges\"\" in 1826.\tHis work related to that of Rumford and Sorby.\tIn 1800 Davy published his account of these investigations in \"\"Researches, Chemical and  philosophical\"\".\tIn 1802 he gave a course of lectures on chemistry which were so popular that publication was requested by the audience, and in 1803 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.\tIn 1806 he presented his conclusions in a lecture entitled \"\"On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity\"\".\tIn 1807 he was awarded the Napoleon prize by the Institut de France for his work on electrolysis, in spite of the fact that England and France were at war.\tIn 1812 he was knighted and  married a widow, a cousin of  Sir Walter Scott.\tIn 1820 the Davys visited the poet Byron at the Palazzo Guiccioli, in Ravenna, Italy.\tIn Italy, Davy used the lenses in Florentine and Roman academies to investigate specimens of classical pigments and to conduct experiments on the combustion of the diamond, which he proved was a form of carbon.\tIn London he had a wide circle of friends, and still kept up his literary connections at the house of the philosopher Godwin, the father of Mary Shelley.\tIn addition to his own experiments he visited tanneries and listened to the opinions of those in the business.\tIn his lamp he surrounded a flame of light with a cylinder of fine wire gauze through which the gas could penetrate and burn inside the cylinder without causing an explosion in the inflammable mix of fire-damp and oxygen surrounding the lamp.\tIn the same year, Davy made his most celebrated discovery when he isolated the elements potassium and sodium (the process was later improved by Thenard) by using electrolysis to decompose the substances potash and soda.\tIt made his reputation in wider scientific circles and he was invited to lecture at the Royal Institution.\tIt was therefore Davy who made the connection between voltaic electricity and chemistry, a process known as electrolysis.\tKnew chemist Smithson William Henry attacked his theory of heat.\tLady Davy tired of fishing stories and Davy cut his honeymoon short, eager to get to work on a new explosive for which there was much demand by miners and soldiers.\tMet chemists Dalton, and Silliman Snr.\tOn his return Davy was elected President of the Royal Society, after a certain amount of manoeuvring to displace Wollaston who had occupied the chair after the departure of Sir Joseph Banks.\tOn his return he was asked by the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coal Mines to conduct research into a safer way of lighting mines.\tOver the next ten years he gave the lectures which made the Institution a fashionable centre and Davy a celebrated figure.\tSet up London Zoo with group including E. Griffith.\tSomerville  FW Herschel and   Airy.\tSoon afterwards he invented the first carbon arc lamps, which were later used by the American Wanamaker in his stores.\tThe lamp went out in explosive mixtures in which the fire-damp was in sufficient quantities to absorb the whole oxygen of the air.\tThe need was for a light that could be safely used in the explosive atmosphere that existed underground, and number of scientists and mechanics had been trying to come up with something for the previous three years.\tThe railroad engineer George Stephenson made a counter-claim for the discovery but it was discounted and it was the miners who named the device \"\"The Davy Lamp\"\".\tTogether with Raffles, Davy was one of the founders of the Zoological Society and the establishment of the zoological gardens in Regent's Park, London.\tWas a friend of  physician Bright.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.03qpj", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
