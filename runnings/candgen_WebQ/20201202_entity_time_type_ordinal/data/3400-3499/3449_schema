Rousseau wrote some articles on music for Diderot, Rousseau wrote an opera and was engaged by Richlieu to recast Rameau's score for an opera based on a tragedy written by Voltaire.\tAt her country house in Savoy he began to read seriously, write poetry and to study and compose music.\tAt the end of 1765 he went to England at the invitation of the philosopher Hume with whom he had been corresponding.\tDuring the next six years, Rousseau wrote his most famous three works.\tHe completed his autobiography,  \"\"Confessions,\"\"  in 1770.\tHe is also associated with the movement towards child-centred education, and the idealisation of freedom as seen in the French Revolution.\tHe once went out with Bernard de Jussieu as far as Montmorency and he attended a rehearsal of  Gluck's \"\"Iphigenia\"\".\tHe returned to Paris in 1744 and set up house with Therese Levasseur, who bore him five children.\tHe settled for a time in the village of Motiers where he received many visitors including the English writer Boswell.\tHe was left alone by the authorities and spent the last years of his life copying music to supplement his pension and indulging his passions for botanising and opera.\tHis relationship with the Baroness was variously that of protegee, lover and steward.\tHis views were criticized by the scientist Bonnet who claimed that modern civilized society is natural.\tHis work related to Herder.\tIn 1725 Rousseau met the Baroness de Warens, a pretty twenty-nine year-old adventuress who had left her husband and taken his money.\tIn 1741, through the Baroness, Rousseau was employed as a tutor to the children of the Prevot-General of  Lyonnais, where he met his employer's brother, the philosopher Condillac.\tIn 1742 Rousseau went to Paris for the first time and struck up a friendship with Diderot.\tIn 1754 Rousseau returned briefly to Geneva to reclaim his citizen's rights and in 1756 he moved out of Paris to a cottage near Montmorency to live the simple life.\tIn Paris, Rousseau became part of a circle involved in writing Diderot's Encylopedia.\tIn the same year, Rousseau finally returned to Paris in 1770, having visited Montbard on the way,  where he was received by the naturalist Buffon.\tInfluenced Napoleon,  educators Froebel and Pestalozzi,  and geographer Ritter.\tIt opened with the famous sentence, \"\"Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains\"\" and discussed the ideal state for achieving the freedom necessary to allow man's natural goodness to flourish.\tMet the painter Fuseli in England.\tRousseau championed Italian opera and praised it for its use of melody while Rameau upheld the view of French classicism that the rules of harmony should prevail over melody.\tRousseau had taken great offence at a pamphlet written about Geneva by d'Alembert at the suggestion of Voltaire, and in 1758 he published his \"\"Letter to Monsieur d'Alembert\"\" in which he defended the Genevan clergy.\tRousseau inspired many of the attempts at communal living in the early nineteenth century,  such as that of Robert Owen in Indiana.\tRousseau managed to quarrel with nearly everybody and returned to France in 1767.\tRousseau marks the end of the celebration of Reason and the beginning of the Romanticism.\tRousseau took the Geneva of Calvin's day as his republican model and criticised the contemporary government there.\tRousseau was feted in London and having expressed his desire to live in the country, eventually settled in the house of a well-wisher in the north of England (Dovedale, Derbyshire) where he met, among other eminent men, the physician Erasmus Darwin.\tRousseau was forced to flee from Paris and went to Switzerland in 1762 but the government there had been offended by his description of them as the \"\"twenty-five despots\"\" in the \"\"Social Contract\"\" and Rousseau had to leave the district of Bern.\tRousseau was received in society and was an object of fascination for many, including de Stael who later achieved notoriety with her book on Rousseau.\tRousseau was warmly welcomed in England and admirers such as Daniel Malthus, the father of Malthus who was brought up according to Roussseau's precepts,  tried to persuade him to take up the offer of a pension.\tRousseau's basic principle of education was that it should interfere as little as possible with the natural development of the child.\tRousseau's political treatise, the \"\"Social Contract\"\", was also published in 1762.\tShe befriended Rousseau and over the next fifteen years provided a base from which he made long wandering journeys, earning a living by his wits.\tSome years earlier, a novel in the same vein by the English writer Samuel Richardson had been an enormous success in France and \"\"The New Eloise\"\" was as successful.\tTeachers who taught by rote stifled the innate creativity of their pupils.\tThe \"\"social contract\"\" referred to a pledge between individuals and the state whereby individuals exchanged their natural rights for civil rights.\tThe American critic Babbitt wrote about him.\tThe education given should be suited to the individual child rather than vice versa, and a child's bad behaviour was the result of interference by society.\tThe following year Rousseau accompanied the French Ambassador to Venice and for the first time came into contact with politics and political institutions.\tThe imposition of rules did not allow a child to develop its own natural virtues.\tThey surrendered their freedom in return for a society in which they obeyed self-imposed laws enacted for the common interest even when such an action would go against their own individual interest.\tVisited by the writer Goldoni.\tWithin this framework the dogmas and authority of conventional religion were discarded in favour of a religion which laid stress on the individual conscience.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0420y",
