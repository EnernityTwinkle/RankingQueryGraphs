That does not sound comfortable. Like, when you're high, and a joke doesn't work, it's extra scary. It's like,\"\"Whoa, what the hell happened there? I am retreating within myself. Why have all these people gathered? And why am I elevated? Why am I not facing the same way as everyone else? And what is this electric stick in my hand?\"\"\tSometimes I wave to people I don't know. It's very dangerous to wave to someone you don't know because what if they don't have a hand? They'll think you're cocky. \"\"Look what I got motherfucker! This thing is useful. I'm gonna go pick something up!\"\"\tThey say Flintstone's vitamins are chewable. All vitamins are chewable, it's just that they taste shitty.

That\u2019s a showbiz term for \u201cAdd sugar to\u201d.\tWhen I play the South, they say \"\"y'all\"\" in the South. They take out the \"\"O\"\" and the \"\"U\"\". So when I'm in the South I try to talk like that so people understand me. \"\"Hello, can I have a bowl of chicken noodle s-p? Come on, I'm in the South, you understand.
