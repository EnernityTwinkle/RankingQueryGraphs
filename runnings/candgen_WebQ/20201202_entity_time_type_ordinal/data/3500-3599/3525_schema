Heidelberg, Mendeleyev became very friendly with a group of young Russian academics, one of whom was the composer and professor of chemistry, Borodin.\tAt the Congress, Mendeleyev met a number of famous chemists, including JBA Dumas  and in particular the Italian chemist Cannizzaro, whose paper on the need for a proper distinction between atomic and molecular weights was highly influential on Mendeleyev's future chemical work.\tBecause of his poor health, he asked to be transferred to the Odessa Gymnasium in the Crimea, where he continued his chemical studies.\tBorodin and Mendeleyev both attended the famous Chemical Congress at Karlsruhe in 1860,  called to standardize basic chemical concepts like atomic, molecular and equivalent weights.\tDespite her good connections, she failed, due to the inflexible regulations that restricted admission according to place of birth.\tDiscovered the relationship between chemical elements, which underlies most of chemistry and unifies a great deal of modern physics.\tDmitry was also refused admission to the medical school, but, just weeks before her death in 1850, his mother finally got him a place in the Main Pedagogic Institute, in which his father had trained.\tDuring his five years at the institute, Mendeleyev excelled as a student, his interest in chemistry greatly stimulated by a teacher who had studied with the great German chemist Liebig Mendeleyev graduated, with a gold medal for academic achievement, in 1855.\tDuring his research for the book, he was influenced by the work of the English physicist Dalton, who had developed the idea of atomic weights.\tDuring the next 20 years, he was proved right, with the discovery of three new elements possessing exactly the properties that he had predicted.\tDuring this same period, he also made some important political enemies.\tFor the next three years, his mother struggled on in Tobolsk, then she moved  to Moscow, to try to fix her son a place at the university.\tFrom January 1864 to December 1866, he was professor of chemistry at the St. Petersburg  Technological Institute.\tHe called this the absolute boiling point.\tHe changed the weight of indium from 76 to 114 and beryllium from 13.8 to 9.2.\tHe enrolled in the faculty of physics and mathematics.\tHe joined the Free Economic Society, where he lectured on experimental agriculture, cooperative cheesemaking, and experiments with fertilizers.\tHis health improved, he returned to St. Petersburg in 1856 to take an advanced degree in chemistry and the following year got his first university appointment as lecturer at St. Petersburg.\tIn 1847, Mendeleyev's father died and, that same year, a fire destroyed the family glass factory.\tIn 1859 he received a government grant for two years' further study at the University of Heidelberg, where he first collaborated with German chemists Bunsen and Kirchhoff and then established his own laboratory, in order to work on the problems of capillarity and surface tension.\tIn 1865 he was given the Chair of Technology at the University of St. Petersburg.\tIn 1865, he bought the estate of Boblovo, near Klin, in order to  show how agriculture could be put on a rational scientific basis.\tIn 1871, he produced a revision, made internationally known in an article by English chemist Crookes in the 'Quarterly Journal of Science' in 1877,  titled 'The Chemistry of the Future',  and showing the correct repositioning of 17 other elements.\tIn 1902 he visited the Paris laboratories of Marie Curie and Becquerel to study radioactivity.\tIn Mendeleyev's first periodic table, he listed all of the 63 elements then known and altered those that would not fit properly, using the atomic weights of the time with great accuracy.\tIn the 1870s and 1880s, he acted as a friend and guide to many chemists, including Tsiolkovsky, who sent his work to Mendeleyev for comments.\tIn the course of his studies at Heidelberg he noticed that for every liquid, there was a temperature above which it could not be condensed from gas to liquid form.\tIt was clear to the chemical fraternity that the table contained gaps, but Mendeleyev predicted that this was because there were elements not yet recognised, which would be found some time in the future.\tIt was here that he wrote the classic textbook, 'The Principles of Chemistry,'  between 1868 and 1870.\tMendeleyev's sister also died of tuberculosis soon afterwards, leaving him alone in St. Petersburg, himself suffering from tuberculosis.\tModern science vindicates his thinking by placing these, respectively, at 114.8 and 9.013.\tOther chemists such as Dobereiner had tried to classify atomic weights but it was Mendeleyev who succeeded in developing  the law which stated that, when elements were arranged according to weight, it was easier to observe the different types of chemical relationship.\tThe reactionary Minister of Public Education, Tolstoy, disliked a chemist with progressive views on social reforms and, in 1880, made sure Mendeleyev was denied advancement until his death from pneumonia in St. Petersburg on 20th January 1907.\tThese were gallium, scandium and germanium, the last one being discovered by Winkler in 1886.\tThis work stimulated Mendeleyev's interest in atoms and molecules and the forces that act between them.\tTwo years later, Mendeleyev was appointed Professor of General Chemistry at the University of St. Petersburg.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0gglj", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
