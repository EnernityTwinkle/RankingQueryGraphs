was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became an aide-de- camp to Washington.\tAfter the war Hamilton settled in New York City with his new wife, Elizabeth, and practiced law.\tAs a foreigner, he did not have the regional loyalties that led other delegates to resist the formation of a strong central government.\tAt that time, votes were cast separately for candidates on the same ticket.\tAt the Livingston estate, Hamilton met members of the social and political elite of New York, including Gouverneur Morris and Jay.\tAt the ratifying convention in New York, Hamilton was the head of a pro- Constitution minority that also included Jay and Livingston.\tBurr courted the Federalist vote again in 1804 when he ran for governor of New York, but Hamilton gave his support to Burr's Republican opponent.\tCompany.\tCongress asked Hamilton to come up with a plan to settle the new nation's debts.\tFurther tensions arose over foreign policy when war broke out between France and England.\tHamilton argued that the Revolutionary War alliance with France was no longer valid, while Jefferson claimed it was.\tHamilton believed that the United States needed a manufacturing base in order to become a strong nation.\tHamilton disliked Jefferson but believed him to be a man of principle, a view he did not hold of Burr.\tHamilton enrolled at King's College (now Columbia University) in the fall of 1773.\tHamilton gained Washington's trust and respect and the two formed a close friendship that would last until Washington's death in 1799.\tHamilton had read The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith but he did not agree with its laissez- faire doctrine.\tHamilton is remembered as one of America's first nationalists.\tHamilton showed remarkable talent and ambition, attracting the attention of Presbyterian minister Hugh Knox.\tHamilton took a strong nationalist stance at the convention.\tHamilton was dismayed by this development, which he felt would weaken the government.\tHamilton was lawyer to Eleuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont and helped him secure the rights to the land in Delaware that would become the site of E.I. du Pont.\tHamilton was opposed to dueling but felt compelled to accept the challenge.\tHamilton was surprised when his ideas met with resistance from within the cabinet, notably from Secretary of State Jefferson.\tHamilton's father emigrated to the British West Indies hoping to make his fortune as a merchant.\tHamilton, the former artillery captain, threw away his shot and fell to Burr's.\tHe drafted Washington's Farewell Address of 1796.\tHe left the cabinet in 1795 but continued to wield considerable influence with Washington and other cabinet members.\tHe lived at the home of William Livingston, a member of one of New York's most powerful families and a friend of Knox.\tHe responded with three reports, delivered to Congress in 1790-91.\tHe was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1786 and joined the state delegation to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787.\tHe was influenced by the ideas of  Hume.\tHe was taken to a friend's home in New York where he died the next day.\tHe wrote letters to Robert Morris, the superintendent of finance, in which he analyzed the financial weaknesses of the government.\tHis formidable debating powers swayed the opposition, making New York's ratification of the Constitution a personal victory for Hamilton.\tHis vision for the nation was one of economic strength and political unity, and went far beyond the loose confederation of states that existed in his day.\tHis vision of transforming the economy from agriculture to manufacturing was outlined in his Report on Manufactures, which recommended government support for industry.\tIn 1790, Hamilton established the Revenue Cutter Service, which eventually became the US Coast Guard.\tIn July of 1781 he led a battalion against Cornwallis at the siege of Yorktown.\tIn March 1776 Hamilton joined an artillery company as captain.\tIn Reports on the Public Credit he recommended funding the debt through the issuance of stock certificates and a system of taxation.\tJefferson and Madison, Hamilton's former ally, created the Republican Party in opposition to Hamilton's Federalists.\tJefferson ran for President in the election of 1800 with Burr as his running mate.\tJefferson won the election but Hamilton lost credibility within his party for supporting his political enemy.\tKnox invited Hamilton to use his library to study and encouraged him to write.\tOn his return to New York, Hamilton embarked on a writing campaign in defense of the proposed Constitution.\tPublished anonymously, the pamphlets were so impressive that they were attributed to John Jay.\tReport on a National Bank proposed a national bank that would combine public and private funds, creating a shared interest between government and business.\tThe American independence movement filled him with passion for his newly adopted country and he wrote several pamphlets in support of the cause.\tThe Federalist is still widely read today for its interpretation of Constitutional powers.\tThe Federalists wanted to throw the election to Burr, but Hamilton convinced them not to.\tThe Report on Manufactures  was the only part of his program that was not approved by Congress.\tThe rift between Hamilton and Jefferson resulted in the formation of political parties.\tThe two men met on July 11 in Weekawken, New Jersey.\tTogether with Jay and James Madison, he wrote The Federalist, a series of essays that appeared in newspapers under the pen name Publius.\tTwice thwarted by Hamilton, and quoting remarks Hamilton allegedly made against his character, Burr demanded satisfaction in the form of a duel.\tUnsuccessful in business and estranged from his relatives in Scotland, he abandoned his family in 1766, leaving them destitute.\tWhen Burr received the same number of votes as Jefferson, the House of Representatives had to decide the election.\tWhen Hamilton's mother died two years later, her relatives sent him to work as a clerk for Nicolas Cruger, an importer from New York.\tWhen President Washington chose his first cabinet members in 1789, Madison and Morris recommended Hamilton as secretary of the Treasury.\tWhen one of Hamilton's essays was published in the local paper and received rave reviews, Knox and Cruger raised money to send him to school in the United States,  where he studied at a preparatory school in Elizabethtown, New Jersey.\tWhile serving at headquarters, Hamilton was often frustrated by the difficulties the army faced in procuring funding from the states.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0b3pq",
