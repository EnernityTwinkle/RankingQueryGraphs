Peel, Ricardo and Jeremey Bentham.\tDemonstrating the influence of Hume, he maintained that emotions took precedence over reason when it came to moral decision making.\tDuring this time, he worked closely with other faculty members including his friends Cullen and Black, and among his students was Boswell .\tEssentially, the intention of the lectures was to direct and instruct educated Scots, who might feel that their standard of English was poor in matters of language and good taste.\tGibbon remarked on the irony of an advocate of free trade benefiting from its regulation, but Smith used his experiences at the Customs House to make extensive additions to new editions of his 'Wealth of Nations'.\tHe also worked with Watt , whom he recommended for the job of university instrument-maker.\tHe had a very realistic view of the Establishment and said 'there is no art which one government sooner learns of another, than that of draining money from the pockets of the people'.\tHe was also on friendly terms with Banks .\tHe was still interested in science and was curious about the work of some of the Society's members, attending a course of William Hunter's lectures on anatomy.\tHe went back to London in 1773, where he was a member of Dr Johnson's 'Club' and, in May of that year, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society .\tHis writing style, which was comprehensive but easy to follow, bringing the subject of economics into the reach of most people's understanding, was the reason for its great popularity.\tIn 1746, he went back to Kirkcaldy and Henry Home, later Lord Kames, sponsored a course of public lectures that Smith delivered in Edinburgh.\tIn 1752, he was transferred to the Chair of Moral Philosophy, which he held for twelve years.\tIn 1766, he returned to England and his tutoring job ended.\tIn 1778, Smith moved to Edinburgh and was given the job of Commissioner of Customs and of the Salt Duties for Scotland.\tIn March 1776, 'The Wealth of Nations' was published in two volumes and, due to its popularity and in spite of its uncompromising intellectualism, four further editions appeared during Smith's lifetime.\tIn his lectures on ethics, Smith considered how mankind formed judgements to help choose the right course of action.\tIn that year, Smith was elected to the Senate of the University of Glasgow and given the Chair of Logic and Rhetoric.\tIt defined the range of 'classic' economics, until well into the nineteenth century, when Alfred Marshall revised his ideas.\tMet Shelburne.\tOn a trip to Geneva he and the Duke visited Voltaire then, late in 1765, they went to live in Paris.\tOver the next six months, he worked on a new book in London, before going home in 1767, to Kirkcaldy, where he stayed for the next six years, finishing his magnum opus: 'The Wealth of Nations'.\tSmith already had a reputation in Paris and he had the chance to meet many of the great literary and scientific figures of the period.\tSmith believed that economic prosperity was achieved through the division of labor and he attacked government restrictions and economic privilege, depicting them as obstacles to wealth.\tSmith entertained his friends on Sunday evenings and attended the weekly meetings of the Oyster Club, which he had founded with his good friends Joseph Black and James Hutton and William Cullen.\tSmith expanded his philosophy in his major work, 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments', published in 1759.\tSmith presented his information with fluency, wit and power, making 'The Wealth of Nations' a masterpiece in its field.\tSmith resigned from the university in 1764 and went to France with his new pupil, spending eighteen months in Bordeaux.\tSmith's arguments were highly attractive to the rising class of industrialists and capitalists and 'The Wealth of Nations' had an impact not only tax reforms, but also free trade and the spread of popular education.\tThe lectures were a great success, mainly due to the superior standard of English that Smith used and they continued even after he left Edinburgh in 1751.\tThese included Helvetius , D'Holbach , Diderot , d'Alembert , Buffon ( the French economists, Turgot and Necker , both of whom attracted Smith's interest, as did as the economist Quesnay ).\tThis was a popular book, with five further editions appearing by 1790,  and the politician, Charles Townsend was so impressed by it that he gave Smith the job of tutor to his stepson, the young Duke of Buccleuch.\tWhen he knew that he was dying, Smith insisted that his unpublished work must be destroyed and, eventually, Hutton did this.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0tfc", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
