In 1848 he moved to the industrial region of Lieges in Belgium, encouraged by the promise of a large increase of salary and the establishment of an institute of anatomy. Neither of these transpired and Schwann's focus shifted to religious meditation and invention.\tHis theory that the cell contains all the characteristics of life was accepted and developed by his successor Remak who corrected Schwann and Schleiden's belief that cells were formed inside a blastema.\tIn 1830, improved microscopic techniques led Robert Brown to recognise that the nucleus was the essential characteristic of the plant cell.\tIn 1831 Schwann moved to Wurzburg where he studied underSchonlein before completing his studies at Berlin.\tIn 1838 Schlieden, a friend of Schwann's, advanced a cell theory for plants.\tIn 1839 he failed to get a chair at Bonn and moved to Louvain where he became professor of anatomy.\tInfluenced Virchow.\tInn 1829 Schwann  enrolled at Bonn University, where the great physiologist Muller was one of his tutors.\tMuller had also moved to Berlin and from 1834-39 Schwann worked in Muller's laboratory and contributed to his major work on physiology.\tOken foreshadowed some of his work.\tOne of Schwann's successors at Berlin, DuBois-Reymond, praised him for being the first to examine a \"\"vital force\"\" as a physical phenomenon and to state its action in quantitative terms.\tSchwann became discouraged by attacks on his theory and from this time was increasingly drawn back into the mystical theology of his childhood.\tSchwann retired in 1877 but remained in Lieges.\tSchwann was also investigating the processes of fermentation and putrefaction.\tSchwann's theory of the cell as the common unit of all animal structure established the modern science of histology.\tSchwann's work on putrefaction and fermentation led to his cell theory which states that the cell is the basic unit of all animal structure.\tThese led to his discovery of the substance responsible for stomach digestion, which he named pepsin.\tThis experiment had a major influence on the development of physiology.\tUnlike Muller, Schwann followed an extreme mechanistic method of study.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.040000", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
