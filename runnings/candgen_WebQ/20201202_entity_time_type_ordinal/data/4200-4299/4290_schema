the year Shelley's first wife committed suicide and he and Mary married.\tDuring her childhood Mary, whose mother Mary Wollstonecraft had died when she was an infant, was educated by her father, William Godwin,  and  became familiar with the literary and radical group around him,  which included the poet Coleridge, the writers Lamb and William Hazlitt, and the scientist Davy.\tFrom 1848 she lived with her son and his wife in London,  and on his small estate.\tHer son now received an adequate allowance from the Shelley estate and in 1840 Mary accompanied him and his friends on a tour to Germany, Switzerland and Italy.\tIn 1817 they settled at Marlow-on-Thames and Mary turned \"\"Frankenstein\"\" into a novel, consulting Davy's chemistry lectures to give authenticity to her story about a scientist who creates life and then cannot control the creature he has made.\tIn 1818 the Shelleys left for Italy in an attempt to escape Shelley's creditors and to improve his health.\tIn 1820 they moved to Pisa, where they lived with a circle of English expatriates,  and in June 1822 they took a house with friends in an isolated fishing village on the nearby Bay of Lerici.\tIn 1823 she returned to London where she found that \"\"Frankenstein\"\" had been staged,  and her father brought out a new edition of the novel.\tIn 1828 she visited Paris where she attracted the affection of the young French writer Merimee.\tIn 1830 she published her historical novel \"\"Perkin Warbeck\"\".\tIn 1832,  in order to be near her son's school she moved out of London to Harrow.\tIn 1835 she published \"\"Lodore\"\" which was a success,  but she was lonely at Harrow and moved back to London when her son finished school in 1836.\tIn July 1814 Mary and Shelley eloped, accompanied by Mary's step sister, Claire Clairmont.\tIn July, Shelley's boat capsized and he drowned.\tIn November, in Florence,  she gave birth to a son, Percy.\tIn the course of the next year,  both their children died and Mary entered a period of depression.\tIn the same year she moved to Putney, just outside London, and began to prepare a selection of Shelley's work for publication.\tIn the summer of 1819 they moved from Rome to Livorno and Mary wrote a short novel entitled \"\"Matilda\"\" about an incestuous father.\tMary Shelley was an intellectual and radical,  remembered as Shelley's wife and as the author of \"\"Frankenstein\"\".\tMary gave birth to a son,  and in the summer of 1816 they took a house above Lake Geneva near where Byron was staying.\tMary lived a rather restricted and lonely life, since her elopement with Shelley had alienated her from most of society.\tMary remained in Italy for some months with the publisher and critic Leigh Hunt and his wife.\tMary was particularly struck by a story about a preserved piece of vermicelli which \"\"came to life\"\".\tMary wrote \"\"Frankenstein\"\".\tMary's editorial contribution is considered to be among her best work.\tOne evening at Byron's villa it was decided they would each write a ghost story.\tShe also revised and published the travel book: \"\"History of a Six Weeks' Tour\"\", which she and Shelley had written about their first travels round Europe.\tShe continued to write, and her novel \"\"The Last Man\"\" (1826), about an epidemic which destroys the human race, is considered by many as her best novel.\tShe failed to interest the publisher John Murray in a book on Madame de Stael and turned instead to contributing a series of biographical and critical essays on European writers for an encylopedia.\tShe had no wish to do so and was able to use her young son as an excuse,  but during the discussions she became friendly with Wright's friend  Robert Dale Owen.\tShe later said that her imagination had originally been stimulated by Byron and Shelley's conversations on science in which they discussed the experiments of Erasmus Darwin, the eminent English physician and scientist.\tShe published \"\"Falkner\"\",  her last novel,  in 1837.\tShe suffered a stroke in 1851.\tThe edited versions of Shelley's  \"\"Poetical Works\"\" and \"\"Prose Works\"\" came out in 1839-40.\tThe novel was published the following year and was immediately recognised as something new.\tThey began an intensive course of reading together, and Shelley introduced Mary to English and German literature, the French writers Voltaire, Rousseau and de Stael,  as well as history,  politics and the ancient Greek and Roman writers.\tThrough her friendship with Frances Wright,  a wealthy radical who worked for the anti-slavery movement,  Mary was asked to join a utopian community at Noshoba on the Tennessee frontier.\tWhen she returned from a long visit to Scotland in 1814 at the age of seventeen, the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife had also become frequent visitors.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.04_by", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
