If you're the boss and your people fight you openly when they think that you are wrong -- that's healthy.\tA man is known by the company he organizes.\tA manager is an assistant to his men.\tA president either is constantly on top of events or, if he hesitates, events will soon be on top of him. I never felt that I could let up for a moment.\tAn executive is someone who talks with visitors so the other employees can get their work done.\tDamn the great executives, the men of measured merriment, damn the men with careful smiles, damn the men that run the shops, oh, damn their measured merriment.\tGood management consists in showing average people how to do the work of superior people.\tGood managers have a bias for action.\tIf each one does their duty as an individual and if each one works in their own proper vocation, it will be right with the whole.\tIf way to the better there be, it exacts a full look at the worst.\tIf you are the master be sometimes blind, if you are the servant be sometimes deaf.\tIf you want to manage somebody, manage yourself. Do that well and you'll be ready to stop managing. And start leading.\tIncidents should not govern policy; but, policy incidents.\tManagement by objective works -- if you know the objectives. Ninety percent of the time you don't.\tManagement is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.\tManagement is nothing more than motivating other people.\tManagement must speak with one voice. When it doesn't management itself becomes a peripheral opponent to the team's mission.\tNot to watch your workmen is to lose your money.\tPay your people the least possible and you'll get from them the same.\tSo much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work.\tSome great men owe most of their greatness to the ability of detecting in those they destine for their tools the exact quality of strength that matters for their work.\tSuccessful Project Management: PLAN, EXECUTE, EVALUATE Sounds simple, but most projects aren't well planned nor are they evaluated well. The tendency is to jump right into execution and as soon as execution is completed (which usually isn't soon), move on to the next project without evaluating what happen on the present project and what could have been improved. Successful project management requires more front and back end resources (and less middle) than are usually allocated.\tSurround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don't interfere.\tThe ability to manage well doesn't make much difference if you're not even in the right jungle.\tThe one word that makes a good manager -- decisiveness.\tThe productivity of work is not the responsibility of the worker but of the manager.\tThere is an enormous number of managers who have retired on the job.\tThere is no class of people so hard to manage in a state, as those whose intentions are honest, but whose consciences are bewitched.\tThey that govern the most make the least noise.\tThings refuse to be mismanaged long.\tThose that despise people will never get the best out of others and themselves.\tTo supervise people, you must either surpass them in their accomplishments or despise them.\tWhen a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.\tWho can direct when all pretend to know?", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 2, "m.04_tv", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
