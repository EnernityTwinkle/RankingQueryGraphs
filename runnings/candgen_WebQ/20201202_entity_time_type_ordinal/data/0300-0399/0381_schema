If they are wholly restrained, love will die at the roots.\tEvery young sculptor seems to think that he must give the world some specimen of indecorous womanhood, and call it Eve, Venus, a Nymph, or any name that may apologize for a lack of decent clothing.\tFrom principles is derived probability, but truth or certainty is obtained only from facts.\tGenerosity is the flower of justice.\tHappiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained.\tHappiness is a butterfly, which, when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.\tI wonder that we Americans love our country at all, it having no limits and no oneness; and when you try to make it a matter of the heart, everything falls away except one's native State; --neither can you seize hold of that, unless you tear it out of the Union, bleeding and quivering.\tIn the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain.\tIs it a fact -- or have I dreamt it -- that, by means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve, vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time?\tIt contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health, to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate.\tIt is a good lesson --though it may often be a hard one --for a man who has dreamed of literary fame, and of making for himself a rank among the world's dignitaries by such means, to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized, and to find how utterly devoid of all significance, beyond that circle, is all that he achieves, and all he aims at.\tLabor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified.\tLife is made up of marble and mud.\tMan's own youth is the world's youth; at least he feels as if it were, and imagines that the earth's granite substance is something not yet hardened, and which he can mould into whatever shape he likes.\tMankind are earthen jugs with spirits in them.\tMoonlight is sculpture.\tMy fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and, altogether beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered.\tNo author, without a trial, can conceive of the difficulty of writing a romance about a country where there is no shadow, no antiquity, no mystery, no picturesque and gloomy wrong, nor anything but a commonplace prosperity, in broad and simple daylight, as is happily the case with my dear native land.\tNo man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be true.\tNobody has any conscience about adding to the improbabilities of a marvelous tale.\tNobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness.\tOur Creator would never have made such lovely days, and have given us the deep hearts to enjoy them, above and beyond all thought, unless we were meant to be immortal.\tOur most intimate friend is not he to whom we show the worst, but the best of our nature.\tSee! those fiendish lineaments graven on the darkness, the writhed lip of scorn, the mockery of that living eye, the pointed finger, touching the sore place in your heart! Do you remember any act of enormous folly, at which you would blush, even in the remotest cavern of the earth? Then recognize your Shame.\tSelfishness is one of the qualities apt to inspire love.\tSunlight is painting.\tThe founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project, have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery, and another portion as the site of a prison.\tThe greatest obstacle to being heroic is the doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom, to know when it ought to be resisted, and when it be obeyed.\tThe only sensible ends of literature are, first, the pleasurable toil of writing; second, the gratification of one's family and friends; and lastly, the solid cash.\tThis world owes all its forward impulses to people ill at ease.\tWe sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream; it may be so the moment after death.\tYesterday I went out at about twelve, and visited the British Museum; an exceedingly tiresome affair. It quite crushes a person to see so much at once; and I wandered from hall to hall with a weary and heavy heart, wishing (Heaven forgive me!) that the Elgin marbles and the frieze of the Parthenon were all burnt into lime, and that the granite Egyptian statues were hewn and squared into building stones, and that the mummies had all turned to dust, two thousand years ago; and, in fine, that all the material relics of so many successive ages had disappeared with the generations that produced them.

In 1819, the 15-year-old Hawthorne was summoned back to Salem by his uncle, Robert Manning, in order to prepare for college, and he spent the next two years studying and working part-time as a clerk in the Manning family's stagecoach business, a job he greatly disliked.\tIn 1821 he entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from where he graduated in 1825.\tIn 1849 he began writing the first of his major novels, 'The Scarlet Letter, published in March 1850 to great critical acclaim, and was eventually recognized as one of the greatest of American novels. Hawthorne left Salem forever in the spring of 1850, and moved his family to a small house in Lenox, Massachusetts, where he began writing his second novel, 'The House of the Seven Gables' (1851 and completed his last collection of short stories, 'The Snow-Image' (1852), and also published a volume of Greek myths for children entitled 'A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys', a collection of four earlier children's books (entitled 'True Stories from History and Biography'), and a third edition of 'Twice-Told Tales'.\tIn April 1846, through his many friends in the Democrat administration under President Polk, he secured the position of surveyor of the Salem Custom House and during the next three years he was able to complete only two stories, \"\"Ethan Brand\"\" and \"\"Main Street\"\".\tIn November 1851 the Hawthornes moved again, first to West Newton, near Boston - where he wrote his third novel, 'The Blithedale Romance' (1852), drawing upon his Brook Farm experiences - and then to Concord, where he bought his first house and wrote the campaign biography of his old friend, Franklin Pierce.\tIn November 1852, on the inauguration of Pierce as president, Hawthorne was rewarded with a lucrative four-year post as American consul to Liverpool and in July 1853 the Hawthorne family sailed for England, shortly after the publication of 'Tanglewood Tales' (1853) - a continuation of 'A Wonder Book'.\tLongfellow then wrote an essay for the influential 'North American Review' praising Hawthorne's work and from this point Hawthorne enjoyed a national literary reputation.\tOn leaving the post in 1857, he had amassed sufficient savings for an extended stay in Italy, where he remained for the next year and a half viewing art works and mixing with the large expatriate community in Rome and Florence, which included the poets Bryant and Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\tOn returning to England in June 1859, he set to work on his final novel, 'The Marble Faun', an allegory on the Fall of  Man which drew on his Italian experiences and was published in London in 1860, winning acclaim in America and Europe.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.05gpy", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
