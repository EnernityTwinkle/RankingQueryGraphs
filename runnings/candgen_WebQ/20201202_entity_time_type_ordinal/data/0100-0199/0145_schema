A public school, Joseph, was the cause of all the calamities which he afterwards suffered. Public schools are the nurseries of all vice and immorality.\tI was asked to memorize what I did not understand; and, my memory being so good, it refused to be insulted in that manner.\tIn the schoolroom her quick mind had taken readily that strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts which saves ignorance from any painful sense of limpness.\tIt is always safe to learn, even from our enemies; seldom safe to venture to instruct, even our friends.\tJails and prisons are the complement of schools; so many less as you have of the latter, so many more must you have of the former.\tMinerva House was a finishing establishment for young ladies, where some twenty girls of the ages from thirteen to nineteen inclusive, acquired a smattering of everything and a knowledge of nothing.\tMy plan of instruction is extremely simple and limited. They learn, on week-days, such coarse works as may fit them for servants. I allow of no writing for the poor. My object is not to make fanatics, but to train up the lower classes in habits of industry and piety.\tNo one can look back on his schooldays and say with truth that they were altogether unhappy.\tNo trace of slavery ought to mix with the studies of the freeborn man. No study, pursued under compulsion, remains rooted in the memory.\tOf all cursed places under the sun, where the hungriest soul can hardly pick up a few grains of knowledge, a girls boarding-school is the worst. They are called finishing schools, and the name tells accurately what they are. They finish everything but imbecility and weakness, and that they cultivate. They are nicely adapted machines for experimenting on the question, Into how little space a human being can be crushed? I have seen some souls so compressed that they would have fitted into a small thimble, and found room to move there -- wide room. A woman who has been for many years at one of those places carries the mark of the beast on her till she dies.\tProbably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.\tSchool-days, I believe, are the unhappiest in the whole span of human existence. They are full of dull, unintelligible tasks, new and unpleasant ordinances, brutal violations of common sense and common decency. It doesn't take a reasonably bright boy long to discover that most of what is rammed into him is nonsense, and that no one really cares very much whether he learns it or not.\tThat's the public-school system all over. They may kick you out, but they never let you down.\tThe chief reason for going to school is to get the impression fixed for life that there is a book side for everything.\tThe first idea that the child must acquire, in order to be actively disciplined, is that of the difference between good and evil; and the task of the educator lies in seeing that the child does not confound good with immobility, and evil with activity.\tWere I to deduce any system from my feelings on leaving Eton, it might be called The Theory of Permanent Adolescence. It is the theory that the experiences undergone by boys at the great public schools, their glories and disappointments, are so intense as to dominate their lives and to arrest their development. From these it results that the greater part of the ruling class remains adolescent, school-minded, self-conscious, cowardly, sentimental, and in the last analysis homosexual.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.06zdj", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
