verse during the 1720s and early 1730s.\tAt the same time, he became vicar of Laracor in Co.\tBetween 1710 and 1714, Swift lived in London and spent time with 'Vanessa' and, when he went back to Dublin in 1714, 'Vanessa'  insisted on going there to be near him, knowing nothing of 'Stella'.\tBy the time of the death of 'Stella' in 1728, the ageing Swift had become Dublin's foremost citizen and Ireland's great patriot.\tCousin of Dryden.\tDespite the attention of 'Vanessa', during his four years in London, he constantly wrote intimate letters to 'Stella', which were later published as a 'Journal to Stella', 1710-1713.\tDuke of Montrose.\tDuring his time in London, Swift supported the new Tory ministry led by Robert Harley, later Earl of Oxford and, Henry St John, later Viscount Bolingbroke.\tDuring the 1700s, he became famous as the editor of Temple's memoirs and he published many  religious and political essays.\tEven though it was published anonymously, it soon became known that he was the author and he experienced his first public notoriety.\tFor several years he apparently carried on relationships with both 'Stella' and 'Vanessa,'  who died in 1723.\tFor the next three years Swift worked with Temple and wrote his first major work: 'A Tale of a Tub', in 1704.\tHe always referred to Esther as 'Stella' and she had a great  influence on his life.\tHe continued to write and publish prose and poetry, including notorious scatological poems, some privately circulated and some published.\tHe knew writer Cibber,  Hogarth (who painted his portrait), and James Graham.\tHe spent a lot of his time tutoring the daughter of Temple's widowed housekeeper, Esther Johnson.\tHe visited London only twice more, once in 1726 and once in 1727.\tHe was immediately given the job of vicar in Kilroot, near Belfast and he stayed in Ireland until recalled to Moor Park in 1696.\tHis 'Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit', which ridiculed the way contemporary religious enthusiasts preached.\tIn 1689, Swift was offered the job of Secretary to Sir William Temple at Moor Park, in Farnham, Surrey, where he stayed until Temple's death in 1699.\tIn 1692, with Temple's patronage, Swift received his MA from the University of Oxford then, in 1694, while on  a visit to Ireland, took orders in the Anglican Church and became a priest in February the following year.\tIn 1699, when Temple died, Swift returned to Dublin as Chaplain and Secretary to the Earl of Berkeley, Lord Justice of Ireland.\tIn 1701, Esther Johnson left England to settle in Ireland and be closer to Swift.\tIn October 1710, he started as editor of the Tory journal, 'The Examiner' and continued with it for nine months.\tIn the late 1730s, he started suffering from lapses in temper, memory and reasoning, a condition now attributed to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\tIn the same year, he published his most famous work and greatest satire, 'Gulliver's Travels', written between 1721 and 1725, which was, and still is, an international bestseller.\tIn the same year, he was rewarded for his services with his appointment as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin and, even though it wasn't the English Deanery or Bishopric that he had hoped for, he kept the job for the rest of his life.\tInfluenced by poet Marvell and writer Charles Perrault.\tInfluenced the

being after the publication of 'A Tale of a Tub' in 1704.\tOver this period, he used it as a vehicle to discredit the Whigs, bring down the Duke of Marlborough and turn public opinion against the war with France.\tPhysicist Boyle said to have inspired \"\"Gulliver\"\".\tProbably one of the greatest pamphlets of the time was his 'On the Conduct of the Allies', published in 1713.\tQueen Anne considered the work blasphemous, so any chance of Swift advancing through the ranks of the Anglican Church disappeared,  but the work won him the admiration of other writers, in particular the group led by Joseph Addison.\tSir Walter Scott published a collection of his works.\tSwift grew increasingly angry about England's attitude to Ireland, blaming Ireland's backward state on the blindness of the British government.\tSwift had formed lasting friendships in London among both writers and aristocrats, including Pope,  Gay and Arbuthnot.\tSwift was one of the central characters in the literary and political life of London.\tThe best known of his writings in this vein is 'A Modest Proposal', published in 1729.\tThe following year, he won his Doctor of Divinity from Trinity College.\tThe proposal took the form of an ironic letter of advice written by a public-spirited citizen suggesting  that Ireland's overpopulation and desperate economic situation could be solved if the babies of poor Irish parents were sold as edible delicacies to be eaten by the rich.\tThen, back in London in 1708, he met Esther Vanhomrigh, whom he referred to as 'Vanessa' and commemorated in his 1726 poem, 'Cadenus and Vanessa'.\tThen, in 1742, he suffered a stroke and was declared incapable of caring for himself and for the rest of his life he was cared for by guardians.\tThen, when Queen Anne died in 1714, she was succeeded by the Hanoverian George I and the Whigs, under Robert Walpole, were returned to power.\tThen, with a renewed interest in public affairs, he established a reputation as an Irish patriot, beginning with the publication of 'The Draper's Letters', 1724-1725.\tThey all became good friends and Swift worked as the Government's chief publicist.\tThey were co-founders of the Scriblerus Club, along with Robert Harley and the playwright, William Congreve.\tThis period saw his impressive poem, 'Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift' and, in 1726, he published the ambiguous poem 'Cadenus and Vanessa', about his intense relationship with Vanessa.\tThis powerful satire on religious dissension was published anonymously, together with the mock epic: 'The Battle of the Books' (which supported Temple's views on the writings of the \"\"Ancients\"\" - classical writers -  against the \"\"Moderns\"\").\tThis was when Swift, shadowed by 'Vanessa', went back to Ireland.\tWas a
