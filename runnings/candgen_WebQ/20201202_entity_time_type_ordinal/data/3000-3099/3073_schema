university with the intention of becoming a lawyer but by 1815 had abandoned this course.\tHe made a thorough investigation of the Magellanic clouds, observed the satellites of Saturn, and catalogued over one thousand stars, nebulae and clusters within them.\tHe published his findings in two catalogues.\tHe renewed his acquaintance with these scientists on a visit to Paris in 1824 when he also became acquainted with the mathematicians Poisson and Fourier.\tHe returned to England after an absence of over six months but was in France again in 1826 where he exchanged geological information with the French naturalist Cuvier.\tHe sat on royal commissions, was a trustee of the British Museum, president of the Astronomical Society, and was appointed Master of the Mint in 1850.\tHe told Fox

while investigating compounds of hyposulphurous acid, he discovered that sodium thiosulphate had the property of rapidly dissolving silver salts.\tIn 1820 Herschel published a paper in which he demonstrated the relationship between the crystalline structure of a transparent substance and its optical properties and he wrote a valuable paper on spherical and chromatic aberrations in the
