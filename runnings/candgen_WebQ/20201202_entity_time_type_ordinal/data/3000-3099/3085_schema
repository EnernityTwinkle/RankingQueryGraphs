 a small ship with few guns,  which aroused no alarm among the Spanish.\tHe was anxious to exploit this situation and there were plenty of eager young men, among them one of the queen's favorites Sir Philip Sidney, longing to share in his dashing exploits.\tHis reputation was such that bells were rung in Spanish churches in celebration of his death.\tHis ships were loaded up with enough gold to crew and equip thirty warships and he flew the English flag on his mainmast as he sailed (out of gun range) past Cartagena.\tHowever, it was not until 1585 that the queen gave him command of a fleet of 25 ships and instructions to harry the Spanish again in the New World.\tIn 1587 he entered the Spanish port of  Cadiz where Philip was assembling an invasion fleet and within 36 hours had destroyed thousands of tons of shipping and supplies.\tKnew Fulke Greville.\tOn his second voyage in 1571, he found a hideaway on the Gulf of Darien on the east coast of the Isthmus of Panama, and scouted the coastline between Cartagena and Nombre de Dios (the port from which the annual treasure fleet left for Spain).\tOn the voyage out, Thomas Doughty, one of the gentlemen-adventurers who accompanied the expedition, attempted to lead a mutiny and Drake had him tried and executed.\tQueen Elizabeth knighted Drake aboard \"\"The Golden Hind\"\" in a public ceremony at Greenwich, he was made mayor of Plymouth, and he bought himself Buckland Abbey, a mansion in Devonshire.\tStopping to pick up the starving colonists from the colony in Virgina established by Raleigh, Drake arrived in Plymouth in July 1586.\tThe finest seaman of his age and the first to threaten the power of the Spanish in the New World.\tThe following year, the Spanish Armada arrived in the English Channel and Drake, as vice admiral under Admiral Lord Howard, played his part in defeating it.\tThe pinnaces played a vital part in ferrying raiding parties and their plunder on and off the South American mainland.\tThe queen was secretly delighted but diplomatic niceties meant she could not show this, and she was probably responsible for Drake's redirection to Ireland,  where he helped the Earl of Essex, put down a rebellion.\tThey also had three kits which could be assembled to make little pinnaces for negotiating shallow waters by sail, or with oars.\tThey had enough food for a year and were armed with pistols, muskets, cutlasses, and bows and arrows.\tThey hit storms and Drake, now on his own, had to abandon plans to attack Panama.\tWhen he arrived at Plymouth on a Sunday morning in August 1573, Drake had established both his personal fortune and his reputation as a dashing and skilful sea captain.\tWhen he had seen enough, he returned to England and began planning.\tWhile they were putting in for repairs on the island of San Juan de Ulua off the coast of Mexico, the Spanish treasure fleet arrived and attacked.\tWith financial backing from the Hawkins family and other wealthy merchants, on 24 May 1572 he sailed from Plymouth in the \"\"Pasha,\"\"  accompanied by the \"\"Swan\"\", captained by his brother.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.031t2", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
