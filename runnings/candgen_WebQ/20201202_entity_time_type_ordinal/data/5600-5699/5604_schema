In 1732 he left Sweden and travelled around Europe for four years, during which he visited almost all the main observatories of  the day, and worked with many of the leading 18th-century astronomers.\tHe was the first to realize from these observations that the aurora borealis involved magnetic forces.\tIn 1725 Celsius was made secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, and the same year was appointed professor of mathematics at the university.\tIn 1741-42 Celsius made his most important scientific contribution, when, to aid his meteorological observations he constructed his Celsius thermometer.\tIn the early 18th century, geographical and meteorological observation and measurement were considered part of the work of an astronomer, and during the early 1740's Celsius contributed many geographical measurements to the Swedish National Map project.\tMajor contributor to accuracy in measurement of heat.\tMaupertuis invited Celsius to join the expedition to Lapland, and in 1735 Celsius went to London, England in order to buy the necessary  astronomical instruments from the famous clock- and instrument-maker Graham.\tOn return to France, in 1738 Celsius also became involved in the controversy surrounding Maupertuis, and in Maupertuis' defence, against attacks by Cassini,  wrote:  'Disquisition on Observations Made in France for Determining the Shape of the Earth.' Celsius returned to Uppsala in 1739, and devoted himself to improving astronomical studies and research at the university.\tThe following year he accompanied the expedition to Tornea in  northern Sweden (now Tornio, Finland), and during 1736-37 he assisted with measurements in Lapland.\tWhen  compared with the results from a similar expedition to Peru,  near the Equator,  these  confirmed the Newton theory.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.010nm", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
