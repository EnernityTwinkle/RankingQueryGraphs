While he continued to be seen as a popular entertainer and occasional movie-player, he contributed great instrumental performances right through into the 60s, when he began to appear more often only as a singer.\tArmstrong (like clarinetist Bechet, with whom he played) took improvisation to such a level that his band mates either kept in the background or stopped playing to listen.\tArmstrong had 'scatted' on a few of his New York recordings, but this performance on Heebie Jeebies created a sensation.\tArmstrong is often credited with inventing 'scat singing' (the use of the voice as an instrument for wordless improvisation) in his February 1926 recording of the tune \"\"Heebie Jeebies\"\".\tArmstrong was far more public in his concern for civil rights than most of his critics.\tArmstrong wore a Star of David on his person for the rest of his life in memory of their kindness.\tArmstrong's expressiveness, his rhythmic imagination and his ability to play the blues were without precedent.\tArmstrong's playing on other Oliver recordings such as \"\"Tears\"\" is, however,  much more representative.\tArmstrong's vaudevillian performance persona was considered an embarrassing racial stereotype, even though he had developed this style while performing for exclusively black audiences.\tAs \"\"Louis Armstrong's Hot Five,\"\" \"\"Louis Armstrong's Hot Seven,\"\" and the \"\"Savoy Ballroom Five\"\" these groups cut 60 sides between Nov. 1925 and Dec. 1928.\tAt age 17 Armstrong already possessed a technical ability and fluency far beyond that of any other New Orleans cornettist.\tBecause most jazz playing was ensemble, improvising had to be kept very simple to avoid clashing between parts.\tBefore Armstrong, most jazz performers improvised in a limited fashion, ornamenting and varying the typical parts they would play in band arrangements and only soloing on the blues.\tBorn in a two-room shack in the poorest ghetto of New Orleans, Armstrong's earliest years were lived in grim poverty.\tEven Coleman Hawkins, then playing with the Henderson band, was overwhelmed by Armstrong's playing.\tFrom 1930 to 1947 he toured endlessly, fronting his own, under-rehearsed, over-worked big bands.\tHe fired six shots into the air and was immediately arrested by a passing policeman.\tHe formed a recording group of New Orleans players and colleagues: Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Kid Ory on trombone, Lilian Hardin on piano and Johnny St. Cyr on guitar and banjo.\tHe influenced Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald.\tHe spent the next two years as a ward of the New Orleans 'Colored Waifs Home.' The home's director, Peter Davis maintained a band, Louis received two years of musical instruction, played lead cornet in the band and quickly became its leader.\tHe was mentored by his idol and role model Oliver, then the top cornet player in New Orleans.\tIn 1924, Armstrong married Lilian Hardin, and with her encouragement left King Oliver's band and migrated to New York to join the proto-swing big- band of Fletcher Henderson.\tIn 1928, the recording group changed to one with the pianist Earl Hines, drummer Zutty Singleton, and a few empty suits from the Vendome Theatre band.\tIn 1929, Armstrong returned to New York,  where he soon became known to the general public, both black and white.\tIn April 1923, Oliver's band made the first of several recording sessions.\tIn August of 1922 King Oliver invited Louis to join him in Chicago.\tIn New York, Armstrong began to record frequently:  with the Henderson band, accompanying blues singers like Bessie Smith, and especially a series of sessions led by Clarence Williams.\tIn fact,  Cliff (Ukelele Ike) Edwards, now best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket in the film Pinocchio, had recorded choruses of scat singing as early as 1922.\tIn several of these sessions, Armstrong played with Bechet.\tKing Oliver's Creole Jazz Band was a sensation with the growing Black population of Chicago, and was already attracting the attention of local musicians fascinated by the new music.\tLouis' marriage had collapsed (Daisy was violently jealous and had chased him with a razor) and the invitation from his idol gave him the confidence to leave New Orleans.\tMany younger musicians undervalued Armstrong in his last years because his contributions pervaded the music so deeply that many did not recognize him as their originator.\tMiles Davis once said 'You can tell the history of Jazz in four words: Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker.\tMost descriptions of these make a great to do about \"\"Chimes Blues\"\" because it contains Armstrong's first recorded solo.\tOn December 31 1912, Louis borrowed his current stepfather's pistol to join in the New Year's celebration.\tOn the strength of his New York recording success, the Okeh company gave Armstrong carte blanche to record as he pleased.\tThe Karnoffsky family encouraged his education, received him into their home, and eventually helped him to buy his first cornet.\tThere are no jazz recordings made since which do not show some influence from these sessions.\tThough some critics suggest that Armstrong's playing became routine during this time, a brief review of his records of the 30s should dispel the notion.\tWhen Oliver left New Orleans for Chicago in 1918, Louis took his place in Ory's band for night jobs, and the Onward Brass Band for parades.\tWith great courage, he refused a State Department sponsored \"\"good will tour\"\" to Russia in 1957 over the treatment of black students in Arkansas.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.04n32", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
