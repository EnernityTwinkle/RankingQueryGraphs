Ptolemy, this model provided the basis for mathematical computations that would explain all the strange things astronomers observed, such as the way the brightness of the planets waxed and waned, and the way in which they appeared to stop moving, or go backwards and forwards in a loop (like Mars).\tAnother of Ptolemy's major works, the 'Guide to Geography', mapped out the known world, gave the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of major locations and showed how to construct maps using projective geometry which would eventually become the basis for the Renaissance use of perspective .\tAt the library, Ptolemy would have had available the entire accumulated wealth of information compiled by Greek scholars over the previous four centuries.\tBooks four and five contained his theory of his theory of the Moon.\tBooks seven and eight concentrated mainly on the fixed stars which, Ptolemy believed, always kept the same positions relative to each other.\tEach deferent traveled round the circumference of a smaller circle, called an 'epicycle,' (whose centre revolved on the deferent).\tEven as late as 1775, everybody also believed Ptolemy's early claim that a southern continent bounded the Indian Ocean, until Cook returned from the Southern Hemisphere having failed to find an Antarctic continent.\tFrom Arabic the work was translated into Latin,  Ptolemy's ideas soon reached Western Europe.\tHe also offered a guide to the use of these tables, using numerical parameters from observational data.\tHe also wrote 'Planetary Hypothesis', which replaced his geometrical theories with mechanical ones, aimed at readers who could not grasp mathematical computations.\tHe explained Hipparchus' epicycle model for the Moon, but noted that there were discrepancies between the model and what could actually be seen.\tHe found that the Earth was not in fact in the centre of the circle, but at a distance to one side, called the \"\"eccentricity\"\".\tHe produced a graphic representation in which large circles (called 'deferents') represented the planets.\tHere, Ptolemy included a catalogue of over a thousand stars.\tHis work related to that of  Maestlin, Apian, Gerard of Cremona, Peuerbach, Al Battani, ben Gershom, Behaim, Plato of Tivoli, Alberti, Kepler, Galileo, Brahe,  Roger Bacon, Bessarion and Plethon Witelo,  Rheinhold,  Waldsemuller,  Halley,  Vespucci and Snell,.\tIn the first book, he reasoned that if Earth's gravity drew everything towards its centre, then this was also true for the celestial bodies around the Earth.\tIn the second book Ptolemy noted that the planets were much closer to the Earth than the \"\"fixed\"\" stars, and he seems to have believed in the physical existence of eight nested crystalline rotating spheres.\tIn the third book, Ptolemy observed solstices and equinoxes which meant that he could predict the length of the seasons and design a model for the Sun, showing it moving in a circular motion of uniform velocity.\tIn the work Ptolemy described the motion of the Sun, Moon and planets and their related phenomena, and provided a mathematical model.\tIt became a brilliant tool for instruction on many topics and encompassed everything from basic principles to complex mathematical explanations.\tIt can be assumed that the research he completed in the library, together with his own observations, provided the basis for his great work, the 'Almagest,'  the first attempt to provide a systematic treatment of the whole of mathematical astronomy.\tIt is likely that he worked at the Alexandrine Library and Museion, the research institution where the famous Greek geometers, Apollonius of Perga and Euclid had studied and taught.\tIt was the first recorded attempt at a solution to this observational problem and was later taken up and explained by the great 11th-century Arabic mathematician, Al Hazen.\tMost of the tables that Ptolemy scattered throughout the 'Almagest' were published under the title 'Handy Tables', which he updated when new data became available.\tNow that he had explained the motion of the Sun and the Moon, Ptolemy went on to apply these motions to create a theory of eclipses, which he described in book six.\tOne of its directors, Eratosthenes measured the size of the Earth correct to within 50 miles.\tPtolemy explained three periods of lunar motion (the times taken for it to return to the same longitude, velocity and latitude).\tPtolemy researched works by other astronomers and scholars like Hipparchus and Aristarchos in order to create the Ptolemaic system:  a geocentric scheme for the universe.\tPtolemy worked on the basis that the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Mars were epicyclical.\tSeven of these each carried one heavenly bodies.\tSome of the scholars he studied had already proposed a heliocentric solar system but Ptolemy wrongly followed the views of Aristotle.\tThe 'Almagest' is made up of thirteen different books dealing with various astronomical concepts.\tThe Almagest' was not superseded until a century after Copernicus published his heliocentric theory in 1543.\tThe Ptolemaic system assumed that all orbits were circular but not necessarily with Earth at the centre of them.\tThe fixed stars were carried on the eighth.\tThe speed of the planetary movements also seemed to vary and Ptolemy dealt with this anomaly by creating an imaginary point in the sky called the 'equant' from where the speed could be seen to be steady and circular.\tThe spheres were moved by the \"\"prime mover\"\".\tThis brought him to support Aristotle's theory that Earth was at the centre of the cosmos with everything orbiting it.\tThis involved a highly complicated model which explained observational data and which had not been available before his time.\tThis led him to discuss the change in direction of light when it passes obliquely from a medium of one density into another.\tThis means that a planet was orbiting a point which, itself, was orbiting the Earth.\tThis system became dogma in Western Christendom until the 16th century, when it was replaced by the heliocentric system of the Polish astronomer Copernicus.\tThis was a geocentric system in which the Earth was at the centre of the universe with the planets moving in a circle around it.\tThis was probably based on the refraction of light from celestial bodies he observed at different altitudes.\tUp to this point, Ptolemy based his work on ideas researched from his predecessors, but in the last five books of the 'Almagest', he discussed his own planetary theory.\tWhen appropriate he also described the construction of the observational instruments used.\tYears later, in the 9th century, Islamic scholars like Al- Farghani started translating Greek works into Arabic and 'The Great Compilation' became 'al-majisti' ('The Greatest'),  or (in the West: 'Almagest').", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0,
