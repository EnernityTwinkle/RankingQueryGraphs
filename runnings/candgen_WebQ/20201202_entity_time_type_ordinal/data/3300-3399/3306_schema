It is a pity that this is still the only knowledge of their wives at which some men seem to arrive.\tChoose a wife by your ear than your eye.\tEvery mother generally hopes that her daughter will snag a better husband than she managed to do... but she's certain that her boy will never get as great a wife as his father did.\tHe knows little, who will tell his wife all he knows.\tHe will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force, something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.\tHe's a fool that marries, but he's a greater that does not marry a fool; what is wit in a wife good for, but to make a man a cuckold?\tI told my wife that a husband is like a fine wine; he gets better with age. The next day, she locked me in the cellar.\tI... chose my wife as she did her wedding-gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but such qualities as would wear well.\tIf I was your wife Sir, I'd poison you! Madam, if you were my wife, I'd let you!\tIf you are really Master of your Fate, it shouldn't make any difference to you whether Cleopatra or the Bearded Lady is your mate.\tIn America a woman loses her independence for ever in the bonds of matrimony. While there is less constraint on girls there than anywhere else, a wife submits to stricter obligations. For the former, her father's house is a home of freedom and pleasure; for the latter, her husband's is almost a cloister.\tIn that second it dawned on me that I had been living here for eight years with a strange man and had borne him three children.\tIn your power, all the same. Subject to your will and your demands. No longer free! No! That's a thought I'll never endure! Never.\tIt's my old girl that advises. She has the head. But I never own to it before her. Discipline must be maintained.\tLondon is full of women who trust their husbands. One can always recognize them. They look so thoroughly unhappy.\tMany a promising career has been wrecked by marrying the wrong sort of woman. The right sort of woman can distinguish between Creative Lassitude and plain shiftlessness.\tMarry a mountain girl and you marry the whole mountain.\tNature meant me a wife, a silly harmless household Dove, fond without art; and kind without deceit.\tNever take a wife till thou hast a house (and a fire) to put her in.\tNo girl who is going to marry need bother to win a college degree; she just naturally becomes a Master of Arts and a Doctor of Philosophy after catering to an ordinary man for a few years.\tSuch a wife as I want... must be young, handsome I lay most stress upon a good shape, sensible a little learning will do, well-bread, chaste, and tender. As to religion, a moderate stock will satisfy me. She must believe in God and hate a saint.\tThat's what a man wants in a wife, mostly; he wants to make sure one fool tells him he's wise.\tThe argument between wives and whores is an old one; each one thinking that whatever she is, at least she is not the other.\tThe fact is that my wife if she had common sense would have more power over me than any other whatsoever, for my heart always alights upon the nearest perch.\tThe majority of persons choose their wives with as little prudence as they eat. They see a troll with nothing else to recommend her but a pair of thighs and choice hunkers, and so smart to void their seed that they marry her at once. They imagine they can live in marvelous contentment with handsome feet and ambrosial buttocks. Most men are accredited fools shortly after they leave the womb.\tThe philosophy of the common man is an old wife that gives him no pleasure, yet he cannot live without her, and resents any aspersions that strangers may cast on her character.\tThe true index of a man's character is the health of his wife.\tThis comes of James teaching me to think for myself, and never to hold back out of fear of what other people may think of me. It works beautifully as long as I think the same things as he does.\tThose graceful acts, those thousand decencies, that daily flow from all her words and actions, mixed with love and sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned union of mind, or in us both one soul.\tTo suckle fools, and chronicle small beer.\tVariability is one of the virtues of a woman. It avoids the crude requirement of polygamy. So long as you have one good wife you are sure to have a spiritual harem.\tWhen I think of a merry, happy, free young girl -- and look at the ailing, aching state a young wife generally is doomed to -- which you can't deny is the penalty of marriage.\tWives are people who feel they don't dance enough.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.025rz_f", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
