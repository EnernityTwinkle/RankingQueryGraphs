jealous of Essex, Raleigh stayed close to him and his friend the Earl of Southampton and went with Essex on an expedition to the Azores.\tApart from his University studies, Raleigh was interested in science, debating and writing verse and had a poem published in the preface to a friend's book.\tAround this time, Queen Elizabeth turned her favours to the Earl of Essex, which took the heat off Raleigh and his secret wife.\tBoth he and Spenser insisted that the prisoners had been given no guarantees of their safety when they surrendered.\tDe la Warr was a co-colonizer in America.\tDudley failed to get onto the Guyana expedition Jonson tutored his son.\tDuring these years, he wrote \"\"The History of the World\"\" and was visited, among many others, by the Indians he had brought back from South America in 1595.\tFollowing Elizabeth's death in 1603, James became King and took an instant dislike to Raleigh because of his aggression towards the Spanish.\tFollowing this display of dashing courage, Raleigh once again won favour with the Queen, and resumed his place as Captain of the Guard.\tFriends with Chapman.\tGradually, Raleigh lost his monopolies, followed by his position as Captain of the Guard and, finally, his house in London.\tHaving allegedly been involved in a plot against the King by the Spanish Netherlands, Raleigh was charged with high treason and sentenced to death.\tHe failed to establish a colony or find gold in the Americas and his final downfall was due to his excessive ambition.\tHe may have worked for Walsingham, the head of Queen Elizabeth's secret service.\tHe sailed in a new galleon named the \"\"Warspite\"\" and designed by Francis Drake.\tHe took this opportunity to visit his Irish estates, bringing Edmund Spenser back with him and introduced the poet to the Queen.\tHe was commissioned to fight in Ireland, under Lord Grey.\tHe was made a Lieutenant of Cornwall, Vice Admiral of Devon and Cornwall, Warden of the Cornish tin mines and was given the monopoly on wine licenses and the export of broadcloth.\tHe was released without pardon in 1616, with the King's permission to lead another expedition to South America in search of gold.\tHis book of verse, \"\"The Phoenix Nest\"\", was published anonymously.\tHis half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, had recently died and Raleigh became the new figurehead of the movement for overseas exploration.\tHowever,  in 1592 his wife gave birth to their first child and the Queen, outraged at their secrecy, briefly imprisoned them in the Tower of London.\tIn 1578, after being involved in an abortive expedition to the New World, he made a place for himself at court, where he was hard to miss, being very tall and flamboyant in his dress.\tIn 1584, he became a Member of Parliament and the Queen granted him the letters patent for the charter to set up  an English colony in America.\tIn 1584, two ships sailed to reconnoitre the territory in North America, although the Queen wouldn't allow Raleigh to sail with them and, when  they returned at the end of the year, the Queen named a new settlement 'Virginia'.\tIn 1585, she gave Raleigh a knighthood and, two years later, she made him Captain of the Queen's Guard.\tIn 1593, he was elected to Parliament and, back in London, he renewed contact with men of letters like Sir Robert Cotton and the lawyer Selden at the Society of Antiquaries.\tIn 1595, he led an unsuccessful expedition to South America to find the fabled city of El Dorado where, it was rumoured, pots and pans and even ropes were made of gold.\tIn return, he gave her the fighting vessel, \"\"Ark Royal\"\", which became the flagship of the fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588.\tIt was there that he was involved in the butchery of unarmed Spanish mercenaries, along with the poet, Spenser.\tJames insisted that Raleigh must not upset the Spanish but, while he was ill with a fever, his Officer in Charge burned a Spanish settlement and Raleigh's son lost his life in the ensuing battle.\tKnew Marlowe.\tOn his return in 1596, his book, \"\"The Discovery of Guyana\"\" was published, to disprove some claims that he had never even left the country.\tPoet John Donne accompanied him to the Azores.\tRaleigh knew that by failing to stop the attack on the Spanish he had signed his own death warrant, but still returned to England where, in October 1618, he was executed.\tRaleigh then became friendly with the astrologer, Dr John Dee and learned about his navigational instruments and charts.\tRaleigh then married Elizabeth
