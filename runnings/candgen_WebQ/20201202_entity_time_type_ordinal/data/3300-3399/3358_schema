Under the specious pretext of effecting the happiness of the whole community, nearly all the wrongs and intrusions of government have been carried through.

year, contained Whitman's acclaimed poem about Lincoln: \"\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\"\".\tAnother poem in the third edition, \"\"Children of Adam\"\", was also considered scandalous because it celebrated love outside marriage.\tAs a result of this and a fourth edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", Whitman's verse became better appreciated, particularly among literary circles in England, where an edition of his poetry was published in 1868.\tBetween 1850-55, Whitman ran a printing shop and bookstore in Brooklyn and also speculated in real estate.\tComposer Vaughn Williams wrote based on his work.\tDuring the Civil War (1861-65), Whitman went to Fredericksburg after one of his brothers was wounded there.\tFor Whitman, the human body was as important as the soul, and he considered every bodily function \"\"natural\"\" and worthy of celebration.\tFour years later he became the editor of the \"\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\"\".\tHe also contributed short stories and poems to literary journals.\tHe claimed transcendentalist Emerson's view of nature had inspired him, though Whitman's view was much more robust.\tHe developed a controversial free verse style that reflected the everyday speech of ordinary people.\tHe influenced the work of  William Carlos Williams.\tHe inspired Darrow.\tHe published \"\"Specimen Days\"\" in 1882, a rambling autobiography dealing mostly with his wartime experiences in Washington.\tHe stayed with him in the military camp for some time, then moved to Washington, where he worked in the paymaster's office.\tHe visited the dying and wounded soldiers of both sides in the Washington hospitals.\tHe went to live at his brother's home in Camden, NJ, and in 1874, he lost his government job.\tHis wartime poems \"\"Drum-Taps\"\" were published in 1865 and reflect how the mood of the nation changed, as the first excitement of the Civil War gave way to loss and grief.\tIn 1842 Whitman was editing a daily newspaper, the \"\"New York Aurora\"\".\tIn 1855, when Whitman could not find a publisher for \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", he sold a house and published it himself.\tIn 1856, Whitman published an expanded edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", in which the most significant poem was \"\"Crossing the Brooklyn Ferry\"\".\tIn 1857, he became editor of the \"\"Brooklyn Times\"\", but was dismissed in 1859 for writing an article advocating more sexual freedom for women.\tIn 1865, Whitman was dismissed from his job as clerk in the Indian Affairs Department in Washington, part of an efficiency drive, but also because the Secretary of the Interior, James Harlan, considered \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" morally reprehensible.\tIn 1867, Whitman persuaded fellow naturalist John Burroughs to write \"\"Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person\"\", and in 1868, O'Connor wrote a short story, \"\"The Carpenter\"\", which portrayed Whitman as a saintly figure.\tIn 1873, Whitman had the first of a series of  strokes that left him partly paralyzed.\tIn 1881, after a second Boston edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" was published, the Society for the Suppression of Vice claimed Whitman's work was immoral and threatened prosecution.\tIn the 20th century, he was regarded as a great American poet whose experimental verse paved the way for later modern poets.\tIt attracted little attention, but it would be the work that would make him famous.\tMet editor Howells.\tThe \"\"Calalmus\"\" poems imply he had had a homosexual affair, but he claimed this was reading too much into the work, and that he actually had sired six illegitimate children.\tThe content of his poetry was equally controversial.\tThe edition also included an open letter to Emerson, which Whitman hoped would help sell the book, but it didn't, and Whitman went back to journalism.\tThe first volume contained 12 poems, the most notable being \"\"Song of Myself\"\".\tThe result was a sudden surge of sales that made Whitman rich enough to buy a cottage near his brother, where he remained for the rest of his life.\tThe third edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", brought out by a Boston publisher in 1860, became infamous.\tThe two most important works of his later years were \"\"Proud Music of the Storm\"\" and \"\"Passage to India\"\", in which he wrote movingly about death.\tThere is no evidence that Whitman was homosexual, but there is no evidence of the children, either.\tWhitman was found another post by a colleague, William Douglas O'Connor, who wrote a pamphlet called \"\"The Good Gray Poet\"\" (1866) which attacked Harlan and painted a heroic picture of Whitman and his work in the hospitals.\tWilde became an admirer,  and the future South African statesman Smuts felt so affected by Whitman's poetry that he wrote a book

Under the specious pretext of effecting the happiness of the whole community, nearly all the wrongs and intrusions of government have been carried through.

year, contained Whitman's acclaimed poem about Lincoln: \"\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\"\".\tAnother poem in the third edition, \"\"Children of Adam\"\", was also considered scandalous because it celebrated love outside marriage.\tAs a result of this and a fourth edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", Whitman's verse became better appreciated, particularly among literary circles in England, where an edition of his poetry was published in 1868.\tBetween 1850-55, Whitman ran a printing shop and bookstore in Brooklyn and also speculated in real estate.\tComposer Vaughn Williams wrote based on his work.\tDuring the Civil War (1861-65), Whitman went to Fredericksburg after one of his brothers was wounded there.\tFor Whitman, the human body was as important as the soul, and he considered every bodily function \"\"natural\"\" and worthy of celebration.\tFour years later he became the editor of the \"\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\"\".\tHe also contributed short stories and poems to literary journals.\tHe claimed transcendentalist Emerson's view of nature had inspired him, though Whitman's view was much more robust.\tHe developed a controversial free verse style that reflected the everyday speech of ordinary people.\tHe influenced the work of  William Carlos Williams.\tHe inspired Darrow.\tHe published \"\"Specimen Days\"\" in 1882, a rambling autobiography dealing mostly with his wartime experiences in Washington.\tHe stayed with him in the military camp for some time, then moved to Washington, where he worked in the paymaster's office.\tHe visited the dying and wounded soldiers of both sides in the Washington hospitals.\tHe went to live at his brother's home in Camden, NJ, and in 1874, he lost his government job.\tHis wartime poems \"\"Drum-Taps\"\" were published in 1865 and reflect how the mood of the nation changed, as the first excitement of the Civil War gave way to loss and grief.\tIn 1842 Whitman was editing a daily newspaper, the \"\"New York Aurora\"\".\tIn 1855, when Whitman could not find a publisher for \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", he sold a house and published it himself.\tIn 1856, Whitman published an expanded edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", in which the most significant poem was \"\"Crossing the Brooklyn Ferry\"\".\tIn 1857, he became editor of the \"\"Brooklyn Times\"\", but was dismissed in 1859 for writing an article advocating more sexual freedom for women.\tIn 1865, Whitman was dismissed from his job as clerk in the Indian Affairs Department in Washington, part of an efficiency drive, but also because the Secretary of the Interior, James Harlan, considered \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" morally reprehensible.\tIn 1867, Whitman persuaded fellow naturalist John Burroughs to write \"\"Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person\"\", and in 1868, O'Connor wrote a short story, \"\"The Carpenter\"\", which portrayed Whitman as a saintly figure.\tIn 1873, Whitman had the first of a series of  strokes that left him partly paralyzed.\tIn 1881, after a second Boston edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" was published, the Society for the Suppression of Vice claimed Whitman's work was immoral and threatened prosecution.\tIn the 20th century, he was regarded as a great American poet whose experimental verse paved the way for later modern poets.\tIt attracted little attention, but it would be the work that would make him famous.\tMet editor Howells.\tThe \"\"Calalmus\"\" poems imply he had had a homosexual affair, but he claimed this was reading too much into the work, and that he actually had sired six illegitimate children.\tThe content of his poetry was equally controversial.\tThe edition also included an open letter to Emerson, which Whitman hoped would help sell the book, but it didn't, and Whitman went back to journalism.\tThe first volume contained 12 poems, the most notable being \"\"Song of Myself\"\".\tThe result was a sudden surge of sales that made Whitman rich enough to buy a cottage near his brother, where he remained for the rest of his life.\tThe third edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\", brought out by a Boston publisher in 1860, became infamous.\tThe two most important works of his later years were \"\"Proud Music of the Storm\"\" and \"\"Passage to India\"\", in which he wrote movingly about death.\tThere is no evidence that Whitman was homosexual, but there is no evidence of the children, either.\tWhitman was found another post by a colleague, William Douglas O'Connor, who wrote a pamphlet called \"\"The Good Gray Poet\"\" (1866) which attacked Harlan and painted a heroic picture of Whitman and his work in the hospitals.\tWilde became an admirer,  and the future South African statesman Smuts felt so affected by Whitman's poetry that he wrote a book
