In January, 1937, Himmler declared that the mission of the German people was \"\"the struggle for the extermination of any sub-humans all over the world who are in league against Germany, which is the nucleus of the Nordic race\"\".\tFollowing the German surrender in May, 1945, Himmler pretended he was a dead German soldier and tried to escape, but was captured by British troops.\tHe dreamed of cultivating an elite according to \"\"the laws of selection\"\", based on the criteria of physiognomy, intelligence, physique, character and spirit.\tHe established a State-registered human stud farm known as Lebensborn, where young girls selected for their perfect Nordic traits could procreate with SS men with equally perfect traits.\tHimmler and other Nazi officials masterminded an internal party purge that paved the way for the emergence of the SS as an independent organization charged with \"\"safeguarding the . embodiment of the National Socialist idea\"\" and translating the racism of the regime into a dynamic principle of action.\tHimmler envisioned  a race of \"\"supermen\"\", of blue-eyed, blond heroes.\tHimmler's first contact with the Nazi Party (established in 1920, with Hitler as chairman by July, 1921) was in 1923, when he joined the paramilitary, nationalist Reichskriegsflagge under Captain Ernst Rohm.\tHis aim was to eliminate the Soviet system.\tHis mission was to bring people of German descent back from outside the Reich and to settle them in the newly-annexed part of Poland.\tIn 1933, he was made Commander of all political police units throughout Bavaria, at which time he set up the first Nazi concentration camp in Dachau.\tIn 1941, after Hitler decided to eliminate European Jewry, it was Himmler who organized the Polish death camps.\tIn January, 1929, Hitler appointed Himmler Reichsfuhrer of the SS, Hitler's elite bodyguard, which was nominally under the control of the SA (Storm Troopers), led by Rohm.\tIn November, 1923. he participated in Hitler's abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich (after which Hitler was imprisoned for nine months), as standard- bearer at the side of Rohm.\tIn October, 1939, Hitler appointed Himmler Reich Commissar for the Strengthening of Germandom.\tIn October, 1939, he ordered the entire SS and Gestapo to father as many children as possible.\tIn September, 1933, Himmler was made Commander of all police units outside Prussia, and in April, 1934, he became head of the Prussian Police and Gestapo (secret state police), even though future Luftwaffe commander Goering was nominally still in charge.\tIn the final year of the War, realizing that Germany was on the verge of collapse, Himmler secretly approached the Allies in early 1945 with terms for peace negotiations.\tIn the first months of the Second World War, Himmler was given more power and more resources.\tInitially, Dachau was intended to house political prisoners, but Himmler extended the range to include many other kinds of prisoners.\tIt was a dream come true for Himmler, whose nationalism, belief in expansionism, and anti-Semitism fitted the job perfectly.\tLearning of Himmler's betrayal, Hitler was enraged, stripped him of all offices, and ordered his arrest.\tMore than any other individual, created the network of state terror by which the Third Reich suppressed all opposition, eliminated internal enemies, and compelled obedience.\tOn his own initiative, Himmler ordered the mass slaughter of the Jews stopped and proposed that the German armies in the West surrender to Eisenhower, but that the German armies in the East continue the war against the Soviet Union, with the approval of the Allies.\tStrasser offered him a position as assistant and secretary in the party.\tThe following year, he came to know Nazi official Gregor Strasser, who had just been made co-chairman of the Nationalsozialitsche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP: the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\"\" or Nazi Party).\tThe offer was rejected by U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Churchill.\tThe turning-point in Himmler's career came on June 30, 1934, \"\"The Night of the Long Knives\"\".", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.03hfz", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
