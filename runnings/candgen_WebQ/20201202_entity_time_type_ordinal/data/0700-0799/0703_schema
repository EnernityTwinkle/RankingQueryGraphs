But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way -- this is not easy.\tAt his best, man is the noblest of all animals; separated from law and justice he is the worst.\tBad men are full of repentance.\tBashfulness is an ornament to youth, but a reproach to old age.\tBeauty depends on size as well as symmetry. No very small animal can be beautiful, for looking at it takes so small a portion of time that the impression of it will be confused. Nor can any very large one, for a whole view of it cannot be had at once, and so there will be no unity and completeness.\tCharacter is that which reveals moral purpose, exposing the class of things a man chooses or avoids.\tCruel is the strife of brothers.\tDemocracy arose from men's thinking that if they are equal in any respect, they are equal absolutely.\tDignity consists not in possessing honors, but in the consciousness that we deserve them.\tDignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them.\tEducation is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.\tEducation is the best provision for old age.\tEither a beast or a god.\tEquality consists in the same treatment of similar persons.\tEvery rascal is not a thief, but every thief is a rascal.\tExcellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.\tFirst, have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end.\tFor as the interposition of a rivulet, however small, will occasion the line of the phalanx to fluctuate, so any trifling disagreement will be the cause of seditions; but they will not so soon flow from anything else as from the disagreement between virtue and vice, and next to that between poverty and riches.\tFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.\tFor what is the best choice, for each individual is the highest it is possible for him to achieve.\tFriendship is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.\tFriendship is essentially a partnership.\tGreat men are always of a nature originally melancholy.\tHappiness depends upon ourselves.\tHappiness is a sort of action.\tHappiness is activity.\tHomer has taught all other poets the are of telling lies skillfully.\tHope is a waking dream.\tHope is the dream of a waking man.\tI count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self.\tIf happiness is activity in accordance with excellence, it is reasonable that it should be in accordance with the highest excellence.\tIn poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief; to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds.\tIn revolutions the occasions may be trifling but great interest are at stake.\tInferiors revolt in order that they may be equal, and equals that they may be superior. Such is the state of mind which creates revolutions.\tIt is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.\tIt is better to rise from life as from a banquet -- neither thirsty nor drunken.\tIt is easy to fly into a passion... anybody can do that, but to be angry with the right person to the right extent and at the right time and in the right way that is not easy.\tIt is easy to perform a good action, but not easy to acquire a settled habit of performing such actions.\tIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.\tIt is the mark of an instructed mind to rest satisfied with the degree of precision which the nature of the subject admits and not to seek exactness when only an approximation of the truth is possible.\tIt is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom.\tIt was through the feeling of wonder that men now and at first began to philosophize.\tIt's best to rise from life like a banquet, neither thirsty or drunken.\tLove is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.\tMan is a goal seeking animal. His life only has meaning if he is reaching out and striving for his goals.\tMan is by nature a political animal.\tMelancholy men are of all others the most witty.\tMemory is the scribe of the soul.\tMen acquire a particular quality by constantly acting a particular way.

We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.\tMost people would rather give than get affection.\tNature does nothing uselessly.\tNo excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.\tNo great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness.\tNo notice is taken of a little evil, but when it increases it strikes the eye.\tNo one will dare maintain that it is better to do injustice than to bear it.\tNor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its members; but that they might live well: for otherwise a state might be composed of slaves, or the animal creation... nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from injuries, or for a commercial intercourse. But whosoever endeavors to establish wholesome laws in a state, attends to the virtues and vices of each individual who composes it; from whence it is evident, that the first care of him who would found a city, truly deserving that name, and not nominally so, must be to have his citizens virtuous.\tOf all the varieties of virtues, liberalism is the most beloved.\tOne thing alone not even God can do,To make undone whatever hath been done.\tPersonal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference.\tPlato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth.\tPleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.\tPoetry is finer and more philosophical than history; for poetry expresses the universal, and history only the particular.\tPoverty is the parent of revolution and crime.\tPraise invariably implies a reference to a higher standard.\tProbable impossibilities are to be preferred to improbable possibilities.\tSo it is naturally with the male and the female; the one is superior, the other inferior; the one governs, the other is governed; and the same rule must necessarily hold good with respect to all mankind.\tSuffering becomes beautiful when anyone bears great calamities with cheerfulness, not through insensibility but through greatness of mind.\tThe Good of man is the active exercise of his souls faculties in conformity with excellence or virtue, or if there be several human excellences or virtues, in conformity with the best and most perfect among them.\tThe aim of the wise is not to secure pleasure, but to avoid pain.\tThe beauty of the soul shines out when a man bears with composure one heavy mischance after another, not because he does not feel them, but because he is a man of high and heroic temper.\tThe beginning of reform is not so much to equalize property as to train the noble sort of natures not to desire more, and to prevent the lower from getting more.\tThe educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead.\tThe end of labor is to gain leisure.\tThe energy of the mind is the essence of life.\tThe generality of men are naturally apt to be swayed by fear rather than reverence, and to refrain from evil rather because of the punishment that it brings than because of its own foulness.\tThe greatest virtues are those which are most useful to other persons.\tThe ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances.\tThe law is reason, free from passion.\tThe least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold.\tThe moral virtues, then, are produced in us neither by nature nor against nature. Nature, indeed, prepares in us the ground for their reception, but their complete formation is the product of habit.\tThe most perfect political community must be amongst those who are in the middle rank, and those states are best instituted wherein these are a larger and more respectable part, if possible, than both the other; or, if that cannot be, at least than either of them separate.\tThe one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching.\tThe roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.\tThe secret to humor is surprise.\tThe soul never thinks without a picture.\tThe true end of tragedy is to purify the passions.\tThe two qualities which chiefly inspire regard and affection -- Are that a thing is your own and that it is your only one.\tThe virtue of justice consists in moderation, as regulated by wisdom.\tThe wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger, since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently; but he is willing, in great crises, to give even his life -- knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live.\tThe worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.\tThe young are permanently in a state resembling intoxication.\tThere is no great genius without a mixture of madness.\tTherefore, the good of man must be the end of the science of politics.\tThey -- Young People have exalted notions, because they have not been humbled by life or learned its necessary limitations; moreover, their hopeful disposition makes them think themselves equal to great things -- and that means having exalted notions. They would always rather do noble deeds than useful ones: Their lives are regulated more by moral feeling than by reasoning -- all their mistakes are in the direction of doing things excessively and vehemently. They overdo everything -- they love too much, hate too much, and the same with everything else.\tThis is the reason why mothers are more devoted to their children than fathers: it is that they suffer more in giving them birth and are more certain that they are their own.\tThose who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.\tTo the query, What is a friend? his reply was A single soul dwelling in two bodies.\tTo write well, express yourself like common people, but think like a wise man. Or, think as wise men do, but speak as the common people do.\tWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\tWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act by a habit.\tWe become just by performing just action, temperate by performing temperate actions, brave by performing brave action.\tWe give up leisure in order that we may have leisure, just as we go to war in order that we may have peace.\tWe must no more ask whether the soul and body are one than ask whether the wax and the figure impressed on it are one.\tWe praise a man who feels angry on the right grounds and against the right persons and also in the right manner at the right moment and for the right length of time.\tWell begun is half done.\tWhat is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.\tWhat it lies in our power to do, it lies in our power not to do.\tWhat the statesman is most anxious to produce is a certain moral character in his fellow citizens, namely a disposition to virtue and the performance of virtuous actions.\tWhen several villages are united in a single complete community, large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of life, and continuing in existence for the sake of a good life.\tWicked men obey from fear; good men, from love.\tWishing to be friends is quick work, but friendship is a slow-ripening fruit.\tWit is educated insolence.\tWithout friends no one would choose to live.\tWithout friends, no one would want to live, even if he had all other goods.\t[The argument of Alcidamas:] Everyone honours the wise.
