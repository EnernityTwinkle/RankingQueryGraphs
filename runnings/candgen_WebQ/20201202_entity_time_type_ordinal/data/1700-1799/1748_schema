'Bellerophon', at Rochefort on 15th July 1815.\tNapoleon took advantage of an uneasy peace to set up the Bank of France, stabilise the franc, and regulate the collection of taxes by employing paid officials.\tNapoleon wanted to invade Britain, but he couldn't break the British Navy and, in the Battle of Trafalgar, on 21st October 1805, his fleet was destroyed.\tNapoleon was in Paris on 10th August 1793, when Louis XVI was dethroned and, in September, took part in the siege of the naval base at Toulon, which was in the hands of anti-Revolutionaries.\tNapoleonic armies triggered Pestalozzi's educational work.\tOn 18th May 1804, he was proclaimed Emperor and crowned in the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.\tOn 22nd June, in Paris, the new Assembly accepted Napoleon's second abdication and the accession of his son as Napoleon II, who was formally deposed just five days later.\tOne of history's greatest figures who dominated most of Europe for a quarter of a century.\tOver the next few weeks, he raised a new Grand Army with Ney in command.\tStrangely, in 1810, Napoleon allowed the medal of the French Institute to be awarded to the English chemist Davy, despite the fact that England and France were at war.\tThe Austrian chancellor Metternich, negotiated Napoleon's marriage to the Austrian Emperor's daughter, the Archduchess Marie Louise, a year later.\tThe British exiled Napoleon to the island of St. Helena, off the coast of Africa, on 15th October 1815, where he remained until his death, from either liver disease or cancer of the stomach, in 1821.\tThe British navy had almost complete domination over the seas so, early in 1798, Napoleon began a campaign to take Egypt.\tThe Spanish uprising against this \"\"enemy of the Pope\"\" was fierce and, for the first time in fifteen years of war, a French army surrendered almost without a fight, at Baylen, in July 1808.\tThe allies took Paris on 31st March 1814 and, at Fontainebleau, Napoleon was forced to abdicate by his own marshals on 11th April.\tThe following month, in Spain,  in what was known as the Peninsular War, the Anglo-Spanish allies, led by the Duke of Wellington, defeated the French at the Battle of Vimeiro.\tThen he made the mistake of annexing the States of the Church, imprisoning the Pope and earning himself excommunication.\tThen, in March 1802, he negotiated the Treaty of Amiens with Britain, which brought the Revolutionary Wars to a close.\tThese victories were, in part, thanks to the development of superior artillery by the French military engineer Gribeauval and the life saving skills of the military surgeon Larrey.\tThey had united with the Russians, who were supported by the Swedes, led by Bernadotte, Napoleon's old ally.\tToulon was taken on 19th December, Napoleon was promoted to Brigadier General and, the following February, given command of the artillery in the French Army in Italy.\tUnable to defeat Britain at sea, Napoleon ordered the European states under his control to boycott British goods, a mistake that caused great resentment among the satellite countries.\tUnder the Treaty of Fontainebleau, he was allowed to rule Elba, an island off the coast of Italy near Corsica, as a mini-kingdom.\tWhen Nelson's fleet defeated the French in the Battle of the Nile, on 1st August 1798, Napoleon was already organising Egypt as a French protectorate.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0j5b8", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

'Bellerophon', at Rochefort on 15th July 1815.\tNapoleon took advantage of an uneasy peace to set up the Bank of France, stabilise the franc, and regulate the collection of taxes by employing paid officials.\tNapoleon wanted to invade Britain, but he couldn't break the British Navy and, in the Battle of Trafalgar, on 21st October 1805, his fleet was destroyed.\tNapoleon was in Paris on 10th August 1793, when Louis XVI was dethroned and, in September, took part in the siege of the naval base at Toulon, which was in the hands of anti-Revolutionaries.\tNapoleonic armies triggered Pestalozzi's educational work.\tOn 18th May 1804, he was proclaimed Emperor and crowned in the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.\tOn 22nd June, in Paris, the new Assembly accepted Napoleon's second abdication and the accession of his son as Napoleon II, who was formally deposed just five days later.\tOne of history's greatest figures who dominated most of Europe for a quarter of a century.\tOver the next few weeks, he raised a new Grand Army with Ney in command.\tStrangely, in 1810, Napoleon allowed the medal of the French Institute to be awarded to the English chemist Davy, despite the fact that England and France were at war.\tThe Austrian chancellor Metternich, negotiated Napoleon's marriage to the Austrian Emperor's daughter, the Archduchess Marie Louise, a year later.\tThe British exiled Napoleon to the island of St. Helena, off the coast of Africa, on 15th October 1815, where he remained until his death, from either liver disease or cancer of the stomach, in 1821.\tThe British navy had almost complete domination over the seas so, early in 1798, Napoleon began a campaign to take Egypt.\tThe Spanish uprising against this \"\"enemy of the Pope\"\" was fierce and, for the first time in fifteen years of war, a French army surrendered almost without a fight, at Baylen, in July 1808.\tThe allies took Paris on 31st March 1814 and, at Fontainebleau, Napoleon was forced to abdicate by his own marshals on 11th April.\tThe following month, in Spain,  in what was known as the Peninsular War, the Anglo-Spanish allies, led by the Duke of Wellington, defeated the French at the Battle of Vimeiro.\tThen he made the mistake of annexing the States of the Church, imprisoning the Pope and earning himself excommunication.\tThen, in March 1802, he negotiated the Treaty of Amiens with Britain, which brought the Revolutionary Wars to a close.\tThese victories were, in part, thanks to the development of superior artillery by the French military engineer Gribeauval and the life saving skills of the military surgeon Larrey.\tThey had united with the Russians, who were supported by the Swedes, led by Bernadotte, Napoleon's old ally.\tToulon was taken on 19th December, Napoleon was promoted to Brigadier General and, the following February, given command of the artillery in the French Army in Italy.\tUnable to defeat Britain at sea, Napoleon ordered the European states under his control to boycott British goods, a mistake that caused great resentment among the satellite countries.\tUnder the Treaty of Fontainebleau, he was allowed to rule Elba, an island off the coast of Italy near Corsica, as a mini-kingdom.\tWhen Nelson's fleet defeated the French in the Battle of the Nile, on 1st August 1798, Napoleon was already organising Egypt as a French protectorate.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0j5b8", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
