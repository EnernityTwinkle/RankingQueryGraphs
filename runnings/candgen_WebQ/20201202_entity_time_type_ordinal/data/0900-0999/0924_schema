And unfortunately I asked the question, but I still got a tap dance. Almost as good as Sammy Davis Jr.\t\u201cThe power of this poet-likely-to-become president first won the world\u2019s attention at the Democratic Convention in 2004. Even that event could have been described as \u201cimprobable\u201d but it stands now as a fact of recorded history. Between that history-making speech and Presidential Candidate Obama\u2019s bestselling books, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope, two things become clear about the power of eloquence. It is not simply melodious syllables or beautiful fury disguised as poetic art. In the hands and heart of a sincere individual seeking to serve the common good, it can represent truth, vision, and clarity empowered by strength, destiny, and intelligence.\u201d --from The Rise of the Poet Most Likely to Become President\t\u201cWhat we do today does not always secure reasonable hope for tomorrow. Only this time\u2013\u2013with the fact of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential nomination\u2013\u2013our country had overcome the odds in a profoundly miraculous way. Like millions\u2013\u2013literally, millions\u2013\u2013of others, I was privileged to bear witness to a gift of history more than 200 years in the making: it was and it is a moment worthy of joy\u2019s sweet and bitter tears. \u201d from blog Why I Cried When Barack Obama Received the Democratic Nomination for President of the United States\t\u201cWith intent to neither idolize nor demonize the man [Barack Obama], it seems fair and evident enough to say that the current president of America is not a leader whose way is that of violent public outbursts. It appears to be more that of a warrior-philosopher who practices the art of political persuasion by authoring acclaimed books, delivering well-crafted speeches, assembling unified coalitions, passing historic legislation, signing well-aimed executive orders, and cultivating a poised but accessible demeanor.\u201d\t\u201cYou are neither Christ nor King nor Lincoln.  But what you are is willing, capable, and sincere, there upon a bough of hope and audacity  as branded by history as any have ever been.\u201d --from poem There Upon a Bough of Hope & Audacity", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 2, "m.02mjmr", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
