including Frederick the Greatof Prussia and, in 1698, he demonstrated circulation in the capillaries of an eel to Peter the Great of Russia.\tThe first known drawing of bacteria made by Leeuwenhoek appeared in the Royal Society's 'Philosophical Transactions' in 1683.\tThe following year, in 1674, Leeuwenhoek made arguably his most important contribution to science, his discovery of the existence of micro-organisms, which he called 'animalcules' found in rainwater, pond and well-water, as well as the human mouth and intestine.\tThese findings made Leeuwenhoek instantly well-known, inspiring scientists such as Leibniz to visit Delft (1676),  or to take up microscopical research themselves.\tThis was a sensational scientific development, and when he communicated his findings to the Royal Society in October 1676 they were first met with disbelief.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0bj_v", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
