Smellie questioned his theory.\tHe was a brilliant and popular lecturer and used to take his students on botanical expeditions in the countryside around Uppsala.\tHe was appointed Physician to the Admiralty in 1739 and two years later, got a professorship of medicine at Uppsala.\tHe was influenced by Gesner.\tHe was lucky again when one of his patients passed on his recommendation concerning cough lozenges to the Queen,  and  Linnaeus became known at court.\tHe was not doing very well until he wrote to one of his foreign correspondents, Boissier de Sauvages, a young doctor at Montpellier, France, to ask him how he treated venereal disease.\tHe was the first to recognise whales as mammals and he linked man with the apes.\tHis first concern was the botanical Garden at Uppsala which had been one of the most important in Europe but had now fallen into decay.\tHis love of classification embraced his medical work and in \"\"Genera morborum\"\" (1763) he grouped diseases into classes, orders and genera according to their symptoms,  building on the seventeenth century work of Sydenham   Linnaeus was also a pioneer of systematic nosology (classifying by symptom),  ahead of Cullen.\tHis main focus and his most important contribution was in the continued development of his system of classification.\tHis system was rejected by Lamarck.\tHis system was superseded by Asa Gray and AL de Jussieu.\tIn 1732 the Swedish Society of Science sent him on an expedition to Lapland and two years later he went on to an expedition to central Sweden.\tIn mineral classification, Linnaeus's emphasis of the importance of crystal structure makes him one of the pioneers of crytallography.\tIn return, Linnaeus assisted him Celsius with a compilation of the flora of Uppland.\tLinnaeus was rigorous in ordering his material and it was at this time that he began to work out a new system of botanical classification.\tLinnaeus was still struggling financially,  and luckily for him, he was taken up by George Clifford (the very wealthy Anglo-Dutch Director of the Dutch East India Company) and accepted a job as superintendent of Clifford's botanical garden at Hartekampe near Haarlem.\tLinnaeus was the first to set down principles for defining the genera and species of organisms and he created the first unified system of nomenclature for plants and animals.\tLinnaeus went to Harderwijk  to receive his doctorate and then on to study at Leyden where he became friendly with the famous doctor and botanist, Boerhaave.\tMost important, he introduced binomial system: one name for the genus and one for the species.\tOver the next two years he was able to publish more of his work, including \"\"Hortus Cliffortianus\"\" (a record of the plants in Clifford's garden) \"\"Fundamenta Botanica\"\" (his method of systematic botany), and \"\"Critica botanica\"\" (rules for botanical names).\tRay in England had emphasised the importance of species in classification and Tournefort in France had produced a plant system based on petal formation but there were now so many new plants arriving in Europe from other parts of the world that a new system was urgently needed.\tSauvages sent him details about mercury ointment.\tThe Swiss naturalist and scholar, Haller, had written to Linnaeus, with the offer of a professorship at Gottingen,  but the letter took eighteen months to reach Sweden and meanwhile Linnaeus had to fall back on his medical degree and set up his own practice in Stockholm.\tThis was the so-called \"\"sexual system\"\" of Linnaeus and it has remained the most practical method of classification.\tTwo of Linnaeus's friends financed the first publication of his \"\"Systema Naturae\"\" (1735) in which he set out his system of classification for animals, plants and minerals.\tWithin a short time had managed to exchange this for the chair of botany, dietetics and materia medica.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.01lwd", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
