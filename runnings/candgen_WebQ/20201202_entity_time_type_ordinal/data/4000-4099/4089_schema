The project was also continually plagued by financial difficulties, when the workers could not be fed, and Keith had the idea of planting bananas alongside side of the tracks,  as construction progressed, with which to feed the workers. By 1882 (the year the French botanist Candolle published the first detailed botanical description of the banana, in his 'Origine des plantes cultivees').", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.016d54", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
