\"\"History of the Winds\"\" and \"\"History of Life and Death\"\" \u00ad and a philosophical romance about a College of Thinkers entitled \"\"New Atlantis\"\".\tHe got a knighthood in 1603 and the following year was made king's counsel in parliament.\tHe was also made a commissioner on the enquiry into the union between the Scots and English kingdoms.\tHe was also making his mark at court and became an adviser and friend to the queen's favourite, the Earl of Essex.\tHe was at last made Attorney General in 1613.\tHe was imprisoned in the Tower for a short while and on his release retired to Hertfordshire.\tHe was rewarded by being given part of the huge fine imposed on Catesby for his part in the rebellion.\tHe was still, however, outside the most powerful political circles.\tHe wrote a history of Henry VII, began one of Henry VIII, and drafted a history of Great Britain.\tHis literary output now became prolific.\tHis maintenance of the royal prerogative brought Bacon up against Edward Coke, the advocate of common law, and in 1617 he replaced Coke as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal.\tHis philosophy of science provided a base for experimental science later in the century.\tHis work was later used by Smellie.\tIn 1597 he published the first edition of his \"\"Essays,\"\" which remains among the most popular of his works.\tIn 1605 he published his \"\"Advancement of Learning\"\", the first major work of philosophy to be written in English.\tIn 1607, Bacon's efforts in Parliament to push through the king's wish for union with Scotland were rewarded with an appointment as Solicitor General.\tIn 1609 he wrote \"\"The Wisdom of the Ancients\"\" in which he gave practical explanations for ancient myths.\tIn 1621 he was elevated to the rank of viscount but the parliament of that year signalled the beginning of his downfall.\tIn 1623 he published \"\"De Argumentis Scientiarum\"\", an expanded version of \"\"On the Advancement of Learning\"\" version translated into Latin.\tIn 1625 a new enlarged edition of his \"\"Essays\"\" came out.\tIn this famous book, Bacon states his opposition to Aristotle's thought and discusses the obstacles to true knowledge thrown up by scholasticism, subjectivity, lack of  rigor in classification, and reliance on tradition.\tIn this he anticipated the philosophy of Descartes.\tInfluenced Sprat.\tInfluenced by Montaigne.\tInspired the foundation of the Royal Society.\tJames I succeeded Elizabeth in 1603 and Bacon bombarded the new regime with requests for favor.\tKing James liked Bacon because he believed in upholding the authority of the Crown.\tKnew of camera obscura.\tLike all his work, Bacon's \"\"Apology\"\" took a dispassionate tone and he certainly revealed no grief for Essex.\tMeanwhile, he had the idea of writing a review, classification and methodization of all knowledge, as had been suggested by Da Vinci in the fifteenth century.\tOver the next five years, Essex, and other of Bacon's friends such as Fulke Greville who were favoured by the queen,  pleaded with her to favor Bacon  but failed.\tOver the years, he been preparing to write his definitive work on the new philosophy of knowledge and in 1620 he published what he considered to be his most important work:  \"\"New Instrument for the Interpretation of Nature and the Discovery of Truth\"\".\tScholasticism took knowledge to be a body of inherited wisdom to be learned through the study of texts and through debate.\tThanks to his alleged involvement in corruption, he was refused an audience with James,  and resigned.\tThe Commons barred him from parliament and from holding further state office.\tThe book was warmly received by scholars and intellectuals at home and on the continent.\tThe next year Bacon became Lord Chancellor and Baron Verulam.\tTwo years later he entered Parliament.\tUsed as a resource by Izaac Walton.\tWas a friend of  D North.\tWas a patron of Selden.\tWhen Essex was in trouble in 1598, Bacon was genuine in his attempts to help him,  but when Essex led an armed rebellion against Elizabeth and her advisers in 1601, Bacon drew up an official declaration of Essex's treason.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.030dr", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

First to lay asleep opposition and to surprise. For where a man's intentions are published, it is an alarum to call up all that are against them. The second is to reserve a man's self a fair retreat: for if a man engage himself, by a manifest declaration, he must go through, or take a fall. The third is, the better to discover the mind of another.
