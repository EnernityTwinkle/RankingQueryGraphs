House  because it was built of red bricks with no stucco finish.\tAmong others, he was heard by the future novelist, HG Wells and Marx's daughter, Eleanor Marx.\tAs a boy, the novelist Rudyard Kipling remembered meeting Morris at the Burne-Jones family home.\tAt university Morris met the future artist Burne-Jones who became a lifelong friend.\tBurne-Jones introduced him to the pre-Raphaelite artist and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti who persuaded Morris that he should be a painter.\tBurne-Jones was a member of the company, as was Rossetti and the writer Ford Madox Ford.\tDuring this period he met the poet Swinburne (with whom he became friends) and his wife, the beautiful Jane Burden.\tHe also designed chintzes, tapestries and furniture.\tHe began to take part in politics in  1876, in the Eastern Question Association, a group formed to protest against the treatment of Christian minorities by the Turks.\tHe considered taking holy orders and using the wealth he had inherited from his father to found a religious community to produce sacred art,  but reading the works of  Carlyle and Ruskin, and their criticism of contemporary life, turned him to more secular interests.\tHe followed this with his \"\"Book of Verse\"\" (1870) which contains some of his best illustrations.\tHe left the architect's office and took a studio in London with Burne-Jones.\tHe read \"\"Das Kapital\"\" by Karl Marx  and in 1883 joined the Socialist Democratic Federation and began to tour the industrial areas of Britain, giving lectures on socialism.\tHe settled with his family in London where the firm's workshops formed part of his house.\tHe was influenced by Hunt.\tHe was interested in producing modern books whose typography would  be the equal of the best fifteenth century books which he greatly admired.\tHis circle included Fabian-Society reformers like Shaw, Beatrice and Sidney Webb and Annie Besant.\tHis love of the Middle Ages was confirmed on a series of walking tours to Belgium and northern France when he saw the cathedrals of Chartres, Amiens and Rouen, and the paintings of medieval artists.\tHis work related to chemist Tennant.\tIn 1856 he joined a firm of architects in Oxford who specialised in Gothic revivalist architecture.\tIn 1858 he published a volume of poems under the title \"\"The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems\"\".\tIn 1861, together with like-minded friends he founded Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Company, who designated themselves \"\"Fine Art  Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture, and the Metals\"\".\tIn 1865 his health broke down through overwork and he sold the Red House.\tIn 1867 he published his romantic narrative poem \"\"The Life and Death of Jason\"\", followed by \"\"The Earthly Paradise\"\" (1868-70), which dealt with classical and mediaeval themes.\tIn 1871 he and Rossetti, who was desperately in love with Morris's wife, rented Kelmscott manor (in Oxfordshire), a seventeenth century house which provided an idyllic setting for portraits of Jane.\tIn 1877 he was a co-founder of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.\tIn a cottage near to Kelmscott House, his large London home at Hammersmith on the banks of the River Thames, he set up the Kelmscott  printing press.\tIn the same year he founded \"\"The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine\"\" in which he published some of his own poems.\tMet the poet Lazarus and painter Sickert.\tMorris designed his own type face and between 1891-98 more than fifty titles were produced by the Press.\tMorris then founded the Socialist League,  with its own publication \"\"The Commonweal\"\" in which he published his romantic prose expressions of socialist rural utopias \"\"A Dream of John Ball\"\" (1886-87) and \"\"News from Nowhere\"\" (1890).\tMorris then spent the summer with a group of artists who decorated the Oxford Union with illustrations of the legend of King Arthur and his knights.\tMorris was determined that the inside of the house should be similarly dedicated to beauty and utility.\tMorris was famous as a poet and a decorative designer in his lifetime and is remembered today as one of the early socialists in England and for his influence on the arts and crafts movement which revolutionized Victorian domestic taste.\tMorris was part of a group of religious young Oxford Anglo-Catholic esthetes.\tMorris's moral feelings about art and design and his love of medieval art  led him to the belief that the contemporary industrial society needed a new idealism.\tPublished Clements Markham.\tQuarrels between between radicals and socialists wearied Morris and although he remained a socialist all his life, he withdrew from active political participation in the last years of his life.\tShe recorded that when Morris addressed middle class socialists he often antagonized them with his forthright admiration of working men and women.\tThe Red House was the first of this type of domestic architecture in nineteenth century England.\tThe first of Morris's well-known wallpaper designs emerged at this time.\tTheir first commissions were for stained glass for the many new churches then being built in England and their most important work was for the chapel at Jesus College, Cambridge.\tThese works were extremely successful and made Morris's literary reputation.\tThey exhibited furniture and embroidery at the International Exhibition of 1862 and gradually became known for their domestic designs.\tThis, in turn, led him from liberalism to socialism.\tWas a friend of Mucha and Yeats.\tWhen they could not find furniture they liked Morris designed some and helped Burne-Jones and Rossetti to decorate it with medieval motifs.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths":
