evidence they had gathered for the reform of the US army.\tAn Anglo-French naval force was sent to the Dardanelles.\tAn electric telegraph line was laid which connected British and French headquarters to the outside world.\tAn incident during this battle stimulated WG Armstrong to begin developing the Armstrong gun.\tAs well as better medical treatment, the troops were issued with clothing and tobacco, and they also received a Christian tract written by Kingsley, the British clergyman who believed that war was a regenerating influence.\tBritain was concerned to protect her interests in India and so she wanted a strong Turkey as a barrier to Russian expansion in Asia.\tDuring a counter attack by the Russians on the British base of Balaklava in October, the Light Brigade made their suicidal charge through North Valley, an episode immortalized by the British poet Tennyson.\tFifteen years later this clause was rescinded.\tFor over fifty years, Russia had been taking advantage of this decline to annex a number of Turkish provinces.\tFrance was also annoyed at the idea that the Russian Orthodox church should have control of Roman Catholics in the Turkish province of Palestine.\tIn 1853, when the Tsar demanded that Turkish Christians in provinces within the Ottoman Empire be placed under the protection of Russia, alarm bells went off in Britain and France.\tIn 1856 Britain was forced to take out a loan negotiated by LN Rothschild in order to meet the costs.\tIn August, the French and Sardinians defeated the Russians at the battle of the Chernaya river and the following month the French captured the Malakov redoubt.\tIn France, Napoleon III had only just re- established his rule after revolution in France and was keen to win military glory and distract the French from domestic upheavals.\tIn January 1854 the Anglo-French naval force entered the Black Sea to protect Turkish shipping.\tIn January 1855, troops from Sardinia-Piedmont joined the allied forces who were now besieging Sebastopol.\tIn July 1853 Russia occupied the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (now Romania) north of the Danube on the Turkish border.\tIn November, the Russian navy destroyed a Turkish squadron at the battle of Sinope in the Black Sea during which explosive shells were used for the first time in naval history (by the Russians).\tIn October 1853, Turkey declared war on Russia.\tIn September 1854, allied forces landed in the Crimean peninsula.\tIn a bid to take the pressure of the Turkish army, it was agreed to mount a joint expedition to take the Russian fortress of Sebastopol in the Crimean peninsula on the north shore of the Black Sea.\tNapoleon III sent an ultimatum to the Russians ordering them to withdraw from the Danubian principalities.\tOn 5 November, the allies won another victory at Inkerman.\tOnly one US officer, McClellan, noticed that the new Minie rifles used by the British and French infantrymen at Inkerman made old black-powder muskets obsolete.\tOther US observers were influenced by the findings of a study of the Crimean War undertaken by Jomini who did not think that the new weapons would alter military tactics.\tPress censorship in Paris and Russia prevented similar articles there,  although the Russian novelist Tolstoy, who fought in the Crimea, succeeded in having some of his letters published and later used his experiences of battle in his famous novel, \"\"War and Peace\"\".\tSome individuals, like Schliemann, later to become a famous archeologist, had made a fortune from the war, but for governments it had been costly.\tThe British ambassador in Palestine advised the Turks to refuse the Russian demand and Britain thus became a direct participant in the Russo-Turkish quarrel.\tThe British statesman Gladstone disapproved of making the Black Sea neutral.\tThe Crimean War was also the first to feature Special Correspondents such as William Howard Russell who reported from the front for \"\"The Times\"\" newspaper in London.\tThe Sardinian foreign minister, Cavour, realised that participation in the war would give Sardinia a place at the peace conference (Austria, occupying part of Italy, would not be present).\tThe Treaty of Paris, signed by Russia, the allied powers and neutral Austria, was signed in March 1856.\tThe Tsar refused and in March 1854 France and Britain declared war on Russia.\tThe Turks drove the Russians out of the Danubian provinces but the momentum in the west was too great to stop the participation of France and Britain.\tThe Turks were given a guarantee of non-interference by foreign powers and Christian subjects in the Ottoman Empire were guaranteed equality under the law.\tThe allies were victorious at the battle of Alma on 20 September where the British saw most of the action.\tThe arrival of Nightingale and her band of nurses in the Crimea resulted in some improvement in their care, and Nightingale's work during the war inspired Dunant,  who later founded the Red Cross.\tThe long drawn out siege (which began at the end of November 1854) was now entering its last stages and one Crimean observer, Oliphant, recorded the surreal experience of attending dinner parties in full evening dress where the chief entertainment was watching the bombardment of Sebastopol.\tThe loss of much of the British fleet in a hurricane during the war led to the first international weather-forecasting conference, organized by the American Maury On 8 September 1855 the bizarre stalemate ended when the Russians surrendered Sebastopol.\tThe main cause of the Crimean War was a desire by the western allies to block Russian territorial ambitions in Turkey.\tThe soldiers were living in trenches and the British forces in particular suffered terribly from the severe winter weather and the lack of supplies, many of which had been lost at sea during storms.\tTurkey was part of the Muslim Ottoman empire which was in decline and was famously referred to by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia as \"\"the Sick Man of Europe\"\".\tTwo prominent British radicals, John Bright and Cobden, argued against humiliating the Russians,  who were forced to surrender southern Bessarabia to Moldavia, and the Black Sea was declared a neutral zone.\tUntil September, the war was waged between Russia and Turkey on the Danube and in Asia Minor.\tWar waged against Russia by Britain, France and Turkey.\tWealthy visitors from Britain visited the Crimea on tours advertised by shipping companies, and groups of tourists gathered to socialize at an hotel run by Mary Seacole.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0cmc2", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

Russian fortress of Sebastopol in the Crimean peninsula on the north shore of the Black Sea.\tNapoleon III sent an ultimatum to the Russians ordering them to withdraw from the Danubian principalities.\tOn 5 November, the allies won another victory at Inkerman.\tOnly one US officer, McClellan, noticed that the new Minie rifles used by the British and French infantrymen at Inkerman made old black-powder muskets obsolete.\tOther US observers were influenced by the findings of a study of the Crimean War undertaken by Jomini who did not think that the new weapons would alter military tactics.\tPress censorship in Paris and Russia prevented similar articles there,  although the Russian novelist Tolstoy, who fought in the Crimea, succeeded in having some of his letters published and later used his experiences of battle in his famous novel, \"\"War and Peace\"\".\tSome individuals, like Schliemann, later to become a famous archeologist, had made a fortune from the war, but for governments it had been costly.\tThe British ambassador in Palestine advised the Turks to refuse the Russian demand and Britain thus became a direct participant in the Russo-Turkish quarrel.\tThe British statesman Gladstone disapproved of making the Black Sea neutral.\tThe Crimean War was also the first to feature Special Correspondents such as William Howard Russell who reported from the front for \"\"The Times\"\" newspaper in London.\tThe Sardinian foreign minister, Cavour, realised that participation in the war would give Sardinia a place at the peace conference (Austria, occupying part of Italy, would not be present).\tThe Treaty of Paris, signed by Russia, the allied powers and neutral Austria, was signed in March 1856.\tThe Tsar refused and in March 1854 France and Britain declared war on Russia.\tThe Turks drove the Russians out of the Danubian provinces but the momentum in the west was too great to stop the participation of France and Britain.\tThe Turks were given a guarantee of non-interference by foreign powers and Christian subjects in the Ottoman Empire were guaranteed equality under the law.\tThe allies were victorious at the battle of Alma on 20 September where the British saw most of the action.\tThe arrival of Nightingale and her band of nurses in the Crimea resulted in some improvement in their care, and Nightingale's work during the war inspired Dunant,  who later founded the Red Cross.\tThe long drawn out siege (which began at the end of November 1854) was now entering its last stages and one Crimean observer, Oliphant, recorded the surreal experience of attending dinner parties in full evening dress where the chief entertainment was watching the bombardment of Sebastopol.\tThe loss of much of the British fleet in a hurricane during the war led to the first international weather-forecasting conference, organized by the American Maury On 8 September 1855 the bizarre stalemate ended when the Russians surrendered Sebastopol.\tThe main cause of the Crimean War was a desire by the western allies to block Russian territorial ambitions in Turkey.\tThe soldiers were living in trenches and the British forces in particular suffered terribly from the severe winter weather and the lack of supplies, many of which had been lost at sea during storms.\tTurkey was part of the Muslim Ottoman empire which was in decline and was famously referred to by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia as \"\"the Sick Man of Europe\"\".\tTwo prominent British radicals, John Bright and Cobden, argued against humiliating the Russians,  who were forced to surrender southern Bessarabia to Moldavia, and the Black Sea was declared a neutral zone.\tUntil September, the war was waged between Russia and Turkey on the Danube and in Asia Minor.\tWar waged against Russia by Britain, France and Turkey.\tWealthy visitors from Britain visited the Crimea on tours advertised by shipping companies, and groups of tourists gathered to socialize at an hotel run by Mary Seacole.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 2, "m.0cmc2", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

made old black-powder muskets obsolete.\tOther US observers were influenced by the findings of a study of the Crimean War undertaken by Jomini who did not think that the new weapons would alter military tactics.\tPress censorship in Paris and Russia prevented similar articles there,  although the Russian novelist Tolstoy, who fought in the Crimea, succeeded in having some of his letters published and later used his experiences of battle in his famous novel, \"\"War and Peace\"\".\tSome individuals, like Schliemann, later to become a famous archeologist, had made a fortune from the war, but for governments it had been costly.\tThe British ambassador in Palestine advised the Turks to refuse the Russian demand and Britain thus became a direct participant in the Russo-Turkish quarrel.\tThe British statesman Gladstone disapproved of making the Black Sea neutral.\tThe Crimean War was also the first to feature Special Correspondents such as William Howard Russell who reported from the front for \"\"The Times\"\" newspaper in London.\tThe Sardinian foreign minister, Cavour, realised that participation in the war would give Sardinia a place at the peace conference (Austria, occupying part of Italy, would not be present).\tThe Treaty of Paris, signed by Russia, the allied powers and neutral Austria, was signed in March 1856.\tThe Tsar refused and in March 1854 France and Britain declared war on Russia.\tThe Turks drove the Russians out of the Danubian provinces but the momentum in the west was too great to stop the participation of France and Britain.\tThe Turks were given a guarantee of non-interference by foreign powers and Christian subjects in the Ottoman Empire were guaranteed equality under the law.\tThe allies were victorious at the battle of Alma on 20 September where the British saw most of the action.\tThe arrival of Nightingale and her band of nurses in the Crimea resulted in some improvement in their care, and Nightingale's work during the war inspired Dunant,  who later founded the Red Cross.\tThe long drawn out siege (which began at the end of November 1854) was now entering its last stages and one Crimean observer, Oliphant, recorded the surreal experience of attending dinner parties in full evening dress where the chief entertainment was watching the bombardment of Sebastopol.\tThe loss of much of the British fleet in a hurricane during the war led to the first international weather-forecasting conference, organized by the American Maury On 8 September 1855 the bizarre stalemate ended when the Russians surrendered Sebastopol.\tThe main cause of the Crimean War was a desire by the western allies to block Russian territorial ambitions in Turkey.\tThe soldiers were living in trenches and the British forces in particular suffered terribly from the severe winter weather and the lack of supplies, many of which had been lost at sea during storms.\tTurkey was part of the Muslim Ottoman empire which was in decline and was famously referred to by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia as \"\"the Sick Man of Europe\"\".\tTwo prominent British radicals, John Bright and Cobden, argued against humiliating the Russians,  who were forced to surrender southern Bessarabia to Moldavia, and the Black Sea was declared a neutral zone.\tUntil September, the war was waged between Russia and Turkey on the Danube and in Asia Minor.\tWar waged against Russia by Britain, France and Turkey.\tWealthy visitors from Britain visited the Crimea on tours advertised by shipping companies, and groups of tourists gathered to socialize at an hotel run by Mary Seacole.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 4, "m.0cmc2", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
