Firestone to produce rubber from domestic plants, but this process wasn't successfully completed until after his death.\tHe wound the foil on a cylinder,  which moved along as it was rotated by hand,  so that the indentations caused by a voice formed a line displaced consecutively along the foil the foil.\tHis inspiration for these projects came from the photographer, Muybridge and the physiologist Marey.\tHis next venture involved improving generator output, resulting in the Edison system of current distribution in parallel circuit.\tHis work related to that of Gould, Porter, Lumiere, Berzelius, Fessenden, Welsbach, and Sperry.\tIf the piece of foil was then pulled back under the pin it oscillated,  caused the diaphragm to vibrate,  and recreated the original sound he had made.\tIn 1859, Edison got a job selling newspapers and candies on the local railway at Port Huron, Michigan.\tIn 1868, Edison took a job with the Western Union Telegraph Company in Boston and patented the electrographic vote recorder and his stock ticker, which telegraphically broadcast stock exchange prices.\tIn 1879, Edison perfected the incandescent electric lamp by using carbonized cotton that burned for forty-five hours.\tIn 1887, he moved to West Orange, NJ,  where he developed the high-speed camera,  and the kinetoscope, for viewing a picture through a pinhole.\tIn 1892, Edison contracted Bright's disease and gastric ulcers and died two years later, holding a total of one thousand and sixty nine patents.\tIn December 1877 he recorded and reproduced the nursery rhyme, 'Mary's Little Lamb.\tKennelly worked for him.\tMajor rival was Westinghouse.\tSwan had been doing the same research in England,  so they joined forces as the Edison and Swan United Electrical Company and produced the Ediswan light.\tThe company's transmitter had stopped working, so Edison repaired the fault and became a full-time employee.\tThe two men soon pooled their talent and Pope, Edison and Company was established.\tThis led him to discover that if he shouted down a horn at a diaphragm fixed across the other and with a pin mounted on it, the oscillating pin would make indentations on a piece of tinfoil.\tThis made light and power more economical so, in 1881, he built the first central electric power station at Pearl Street, New York,  and later set up the Edison General Electric Company.\tUnable to find buyers,   he approached Franklin L. Pope, a telegraph engineer with New York's Gold Indicator Company.\tWestern Union bought the improvement rights,  so Edison set up his own factory at Newark, employing John Kreuzi, Charles Batchelor and Acheson to produce stock tickers and other telegraphic equipment.\tWhen turned over, another stylus bumping up and down over the indentations made and broke an electrical contact and retransmitted the message.\tWith the profits, he bought Menlo Park, New Jersey and set up an establishment purely for research and invention.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.07bty", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
