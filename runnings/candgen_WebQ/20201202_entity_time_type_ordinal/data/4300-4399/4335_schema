It must not look to the left or right but go forward.\tA government, for protecting business only, is but a carcass, and soon falls by its own corruption and decay.\tA man without a vote is man without protection.\tAn educated people can be easily governed.\tAny cook should be able to run the country.\tAs long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property, liberty of conscience and of the press, it will be worth defending.\tBe thankful we're not getting all the government we're paying for.\tBelieve me - the Government will help you anytime it needs you.\tBureaucracy is a giant mechanism operated by pygmies.\tBy definition, a government has no conscience. Sometimes it has a policy, but nothing more.\tDo not ask what the Government can do for you. Ask why it doesn't.\tEven to observe neutrality you must have a strong government.\tEvery country has the government it deserves.\tEvery form of government tends to perish by excess of its basic principles.\tFear is the foundation of most government.\tFor Forms of Government let fools contest; whatever is best administered is best.\tFor its part, Government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways -- to the voices of quiet anguish, to voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart, to the injured voices, and the anxious voices, and the voices that have despaired of being heard.\tFreedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power vested in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, when the rule prescribes not, and not to be subject to the inconstant, unknown, arbitrary will of another man.\tGiving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.\tGood government is the outcome of private virtue.\tGoverning today means giving acceptable signs of credibility. It is like advertising and it is the same effect that is achieved -- commitment to a scenario.\tGovernment does not solve problems; it subsidizes them.\tGovernment has no other end, but the preservation of property.\tGovernment is actually the worst failure of civilized man. There has never been a really good one, and even those that are most tolerable are arbitrary, cruel, grasping and unintelligent.\tGovernment is an evil; it is only the thoughtlessness and vices of men that make it a necessary evil. When all men are good and wise, government will of itself decay.\tGovernment is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government.\tGovernment is either organized benevolence or organized madness; its peculiar magnitude permits no shading.\tGovernment is like a baby. An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.\tGovernment is not reason and it is not eloquence. It is force! Like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.\tGovernments need to have both shepherds and butchers.\tGovernments never learn. Only people learn.\tGovernments tend not to solve problems, only to rearrange them.\tI don't judge a regime by the damning criticism of the opposition, but by the ingenuous praise of the partisan.\tI don't make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.\tI have no ambition to govern men. It is a painful and thankless office\tI love my government not least for the extent to which it leaves me alone.\tI would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another. It is of no moment to the happiness of an individual.\tIf you join government, calmly make your contribution and move on. Don't go along to get along; do your best and when you have to -- and you will -- leave, and be something else.\tIn a healthy nation there is a kind of dramatic balance between the will of the people and the government, which prevents its degeneration into tyranny.\tIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.\tIn the councils of a state, the question is not so much, what ought to be done? As, what can be done?\tIn the long-run every Government is the exact symbol of its People, with their wisdom and unwisdom; we have to say, Like People like Government.\tIt could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.\tIt is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong.\tIt is easy to rule over the good.\tIt is hard to feel individually responsible with respect to the invisible processes of a huge and distant government.\tIt is often said that men are ruled by their imaginations; but it would be truer to say they are governed by the weakness of their imaginations.\tIt is perfectly true that that government is best which governs least. It is equally true that that government is best which provides most.\tIt is the duty of government to make it difficult for people to do wrong, easy to do right.\tIt is the duty of the President to propose and it is the privilege of the Congress to dispose.\tIt is very easy to accuse a government of imperfection, for all mortal things are full of it.\tIt would be foolish to suggest that government is a good custodian of aesthetic goals. But, there is no alternative to the state.\tLarge legislative bodies resolve themselves into coteries, and coteries into jealousies.\tMankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own government.\tMany forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those others that have been tried from time to time.\tMany people want the government to protect the consumer. A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.\tMen are not governed by justice, but by law or persuasion. When they refuse to be governed by law or persuasion, they have to be governed by force or fraud, or both.\tMen are to be guided only by their self-interests. Good government is a good balancing of these; and, except a keen eye and appetite for self-interest, requires no virtue in any quarter. To both parties it is emphatically a machine: to the discontented, a taxing-machine; to the contented, a machine for securing property. Its duties and its faults are not those of a father, but of an active parish-constable.\tMy reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government.\tNations it may be have fashioned their Governments, but the Governments have paid them back in the same coin.\tNeither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. -- The Motto Of The U.S. Postal Service\tNo man undertakes a trade he has not learned, even the meanest; yet everyone thinks himself sufficiently qualified for the hardest of all trades, that of government.\tNothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.\tNothing is more surprising than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.\tNothing is so galling to a people not broken in from the birth as a paternal, or in other words a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read and say and eat and drink and wear.\tNothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government.\tOf the best rulers, The people only know that they exist; the next best they love and praise the next they fear; and the next they revile. When they do not command the people's faith, some will lose faith in them, and then they resort to oaths! But of the best when their task is accomplished, their work done, the people all remark, We have done it ourselves.\tOffice without pay makes thieves.\tPublic instruction should be the first object of government.\tSociety in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one.\tThat government is best which governs least.\tThat government is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part.\tThe art of government is not to let me grow stale.\tThe art of government is the organization of idolatry. The bureaucracy consists of functionaries; the aristocracy, of idols; the democracy, of idolaters. The populace cannot understand the bureaucracy: it can only worship the national idols.\tThe basis of effective government if public confidence.\tThe best government is a benevolent tyranny tempered by an occasional assassination.\tThe best government is that which teaches us to govern ourselves.\tThe body politic, as well as the human body, begins to die as soon as it is born, and carries itself the causes of its destruction.\tThe care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\tThe constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.\tThe contented and economically comfortable have a very discriminating view of government. Nobody is ever indignant about bailing out failed banks and failed savings and loans associations. But when taxes must be paid for the lower middle class and poor, the government assumes an aspect of wickedness.\tThe government is best which makes itself unnecessary.\tThe government is huge, stupid, greedy and makes nosy, officious and dangerous intrusions into the smallest corners of life -- this much we can stand. But the real problem is that government is boring. We could cure or mitigate the other ills Washington visits on us if we could only bring ourselves to pay attention to Washington itself. But we cannot.\tThe government is us; we are the government, you and I.\tThe government of the world I live in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner conversations over the wine.\tThe government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem.\tThe less government we have the better.\tThe mechanism that directs government cannot be virtuous, because it is impossible to thwart every crime, to protect oneself from every criminal without being criminal too; that which directs corrupt mankind must be corrupt itself; and it will never be by means of virtue, virtue being inert and passive, that you will maintain control over vice, which is ever active: the governor must be more energetic than the governed.\tThe punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government, is to live under the government of worse men.\tThe supply of government exceeds demand.\tThe three great ends which a statesman ought to propose to himself in the government of a nation, are -- 1. Security to possessors; 2. Facility to acquirers; and, 3. Hope to all.\tThe whole duty of government is to prevent crime and to preserve contracts.\tThe worst thing in the world next to anarchy, is government.\tThere are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses.\tThere is no nonsense so arrant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate government action.\tThere is something to be said for government by a great aristocracy which has furnished leaders to the nation in peace and war for generations; even a democrat like myself must admit this. But there is absolutely nothing to be said for government by a plutocracy, for government by men very powerful in certain lines and gifted with the money touch, but with ideals which in their essence are merely those of so many glorified pawnbrokers.\tThis American government -- what is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will.\tThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forced by the occasion.\tThou camest out of thy mother's belly without government, thou hast liv'd hitherto without government, and thou mayst be carried to thy long home without government, when it shall please the Lord. How many people in this world live without government, yet do well enough, and are well look'd upon?\tThough the people support the government; the government should not support the people.\tTo rule is not so much a question of the heavy hand as the firm seat.\tToday, if you invent a better mousetrap, the government comes along with a better mouse.\tToo bad that all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxicabs and cutting hair.\tTruth is the glue that holds government together.\tWe have the best government that money can buy.\tWe must judge a government by its general tendencies and not by its happy accidents.\tWhat is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\tWhen any government, or church for that matter, undertakes to say to it's subjects,  this you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden to know the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motive.\tWhenever the people are well informed, they can be trusted with their own government; that whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied on to set them to rights.\tWhenever you have an efficient government, you have a dictatorship.\tWho so taketh in hand to frame any state or government ought to presuppose that all men are evil, and at occasions will show themselves so to be.\tYou could afford your house without the government if it weren't for the government.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.036nz", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
