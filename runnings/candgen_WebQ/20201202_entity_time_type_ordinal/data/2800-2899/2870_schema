experiment could only confirm or maybe deny.\tBetween 1652 and 1653, Boyle spent time in Ireland sorting out the family estates.\tBoyle became famous in his own lifetime and was visited by many foreigners of distinction, including the physicist Papin, with whom he worked during the late 1670s.\tBoyle described these experiments in 1660, in his first published scientific work, 'New Experiments Physio-Mechanical, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects'.\tBoyle is considered one of the founders of the modern scientific method, because of his belief in the necessity of objective observation and experimentation in scientific studies, and his devotion to verifiable laboratory experiments.\tBoyle went back to Geneva, then home to Ireland in 1644 and, although he had inherited the impoverished manor of Stalbridge in Dorset, England, chose instead to stay for a year in London with his favourite sister, the brilliant Katherine, Lady Ranelagh.\tBoyle's other objective was to show that the best way to demonstrate the mechanical view was by the use of careful and methodical experimentation, and in 1662 and 1663 he was involved a long argument with the philosopher Spinoza on the question of whether experiment would provide proof.\tDuring the 1660s, Boyle carried out investigation into physic as well, including the gas laws, the expansion of water on freezing, hydrostatic pressure, specific gravity, the refractive index, color and electricity.\tFourteen years later, this law was independently stated by Mariotte, and became known in France as 'Mariotte's Law.\tFrom 1654 until 1668, Boyle, who set up what became a famous laboratory, took on Hooke as his assistant, and mixed with many important intellectuals, including Wilkins, Wallis, Wren, Sprat, and the students Sydenham and Locke.\tFrom Switzerland, he moved to Florence in 1641, where, over a year, he mastered Italian and was introduced to the new science, reading 'Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems' by Galileo, who died during his stay there in early 1642.\tHaving developed a fascination for chemistry and alchemy, Boyle read all the available works on the subjects and built himself a private laboratory.\tHe became a founder member of the Royal Society in 1660, wrote treatises on natural theology in the manner of his friends Wilkins,  Tillotson and Barrow and continued to study Christianity, learning Hebrew, Greek, Chaldean and Syriac.\tHe knew Oldenburg, Sloane and Winthrop.\tHe knew the work of fellow-member of the Royal Society Leeuwenhoek.\tHe occasionally went to London, where, through his sister, he met  Wilkins and  Petty and attended a few of the early informal meetings which would, fifteen years later, become the Royal Society.\tHe retired from the Royal Society in 1689.\tHe was also a member of the East India Company and a governor of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.\tHe was an early exponent of the miasma theory He met Leibniz.\tHis work related to that of Gassendi.\tHooke, an inventor himself and later to become Curator of Experiments at the Royal Society, produced the perfect design.\tIn 1639, Robert Boyle went on a tour of Europe with Francis, his older brother, and a private tutor.\tIn 1645,  Boyle moved to his Dorset estate, where he began experimental work.\tIn 1654, Boyle moved into lodgings in the city, bringing with him his own chemist, a Mr Staehl from Strasbourg, as a technical tutor.\tIn 1657, Boyle heard about Guericke's invention of an air pump and, recognizing straight away its scientific possibilities, he set his assistants the job of designing an improved version.\tIn 1668, because of ill health, Boyle finally left Oxford for London, where he became friendly with the diarist Evelyn and carried on experimenting.\tIn 1680, he was asked to become President of the Royal Society, but refused the job because.\tIn his two publications of 1661, 'Certain Physiological Essays' and 'The Sceptical Chymist', Boyle's first aim was to disprove the old theory of the 'four elements': earth, air, fire, and water, as well as the 'three principles': salt, sulphur, and mercury, and to put a mechanical theory of matter in their place.\tIn the first few years of the decade, he published three works showing the results of his studies, 'Experiments and Considerations Touching Colors', in 1664, 'New Experiments and Observations Touching Cold' in 1665 and 'Hydrostatic Paradoxes' a year later.\tIn the second edition two years later, he added what became known as 'Boyle's Law', stating that if the temperature and quantity of a gas remain constant, the volume varies inversely with the pressure.\tKnew the poet Dryden.\tRight through his life, Boyle continued experimenting with the air pump, among other things showing that fruits and vegetables contained air (in fact carbon dioxide) that they gave off during fermentation.\tSaw instrument from the Accademia del Cimento.\tShe was a strong Parliamentarian and a friend of Milton, who introduced him to, among others, the educationalist  Hartlib, who became a lifelong friend.\tThe following year, Boyle published his first work, a collection of moral essays called 'Occasional Reflections upon Several Subjects', one of which, 'Upon the Eating of Oysters', is thought to have inspired Swift to write 'Gulliver's Travels' in 1726.\tThen, following the experiments of Mersenne, Boyle proved that air was essential for the transmission of sound and that air was elastic.\tThey spent 21 months in Geneva, where Boyle studied French, mathematics and the polite arts, which included dancing and fencing.\tTo Boyle, experiment was an essential ingredient of proof.\tTogether, he and Boyle built the pump that would allow Boyle to conduct a brilliant series of experiments on the physical nature of air, in which he proved, following Torricelli's work on the vacuum ten years before, that air was necessary for combustion and respiration.\tWas influenced by William Gilbert Haukesbee repeated his experiments Christiaan Huyghens saw his vacuum experiments He used the camera obscura.\tWhen Boyle went back to England, he was invited by Wilkins, now Warden of Wadham College, to join him in Oxford, where most of the leaders of the English scientific movement were living.\tWhile he was in Geneva, he became greatly influenced by the Calvinist movement.\tWhile he was there, he renewed his acquaintance with Sir William Petty, who taught him about anatomy, physiology and the experimental technique.\tWith little support at first, Boyle's views gradually gained ground and greatly influenced the development of the experimental method in the late 17th century by Newton,  one of John Locke's most faithful followers.",
