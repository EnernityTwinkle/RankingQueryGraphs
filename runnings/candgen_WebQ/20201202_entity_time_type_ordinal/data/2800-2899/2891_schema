It ought to be forbidden to ignorant innocents, never allowed into contact with those not sufficiently prepared. Yes, art is dangerous. Where it is chaste, it is not art.\tArt is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon. When we love a woman we don't start measuring her limbs.\tArt washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\tColors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions.\tComputers are useless.

The problem is to remain an artist once they grow up.\tEverything is a miracle. It is a miracle that one does not dissolve in one's bath like a lump of sugar.\tEverything you can imagine is real.\tGod is really only another artist.

He just keeps on trying other things.\tGood artists copy, great artists steal\tI am always doing things I can't do, that's how I get to do them.\tI do not seek, I find.\tI have a horror of people who speak about the beautiful. What is the beautiful? One must speak of problems in painting!\tI paint objects as I think them not as I see them.\tI who have been involved with all styles of painting can assure you that the only things that fluctuate are the waves of fashion which carry the snobs and speculators; the number of true connoisseurs remains more or less the same.\tIf I spit, they will take my spit and frame it as great art.\tIf everybody is looking for it, then nobody is finding it. If we were cultured, we would not be conscious of lacking culture. We would regard it as something natural and would not make so much fuss about it. And if we knew the real value of this word we would be cultured enough not to give it so much importance.\tIf only we could pull out our brain and use only our eyes.\tIs there anything more dangerous than sympathetic understanding?\tIt is personality with a penny's worth of talent.

He recopies it five times, ten times, always clarifying the line.

In drawing, nothing is better than the first attempt.\tMuseums are just a lot of lies, and the people who make art their business are mostly imposters. We have infected the pictures in museums with all our stupidities, all our mistakes, all our poverty of spirit. We have turned them into petty and ridiculous things.\tNever permit a dichotomy to rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time. Look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time.\tNow there is fame! Of all -- hunger, misery, the incomprehension by the public -- fame is by far the worst. It is the castigation of God by the artist. It is sad.

Art is a lie that makes us realize truth, at least the truth that is given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies.\tWe must not discriminate between things. Where things are concerned there are no class distinctions. We must pick out what is good for us where we can find it.\tWhat is a face, really? Its own photo? Its make-up? Or is it a face as painted by such or such painter? That which is in front? Inside?

in 1896, he was disappointed not to win a prize at the Exhibition of Fine Arts in Barcelona, for which he had entered \"\"The First Communion\"\".\tAt this time, the poet and art critic Apollinaire appeared in Picasso's pictures and also wrote about him.\tBorn to a father who was a professor of drawing, Picasso showed artistic talent from a very early age.\tBy the time he was eight, his father had taken him to bullfights and around 1889, Picasso painted a picture of a picador in a bullring.\tDuring the 1920s, Picasso and Olga became part of  fashionable society in Paris,  but in 1927, he met his new mistress, the seventeen year old Marie-Therese Walter.\tDuring the 1939 - 1945 War, Picasso stayed in Paris.\tDuring this time he produced \"\"The Kiss of Death\"\", \"\"The Cry of Death\"\", \"\"Two Agonies\"\" and \"\"Presence of Death\"\".\tEva Marcelle had replaced Fernande as his mistress in 1910, but she died in 1915.\tFascinated by the street life of Paris, he drew and painted it in a variety of mediums.\tHe also met Olga Kokhlova, a dancer, whom he later married.\tHe also painted his own variations of pictures by other artists and completed a series of paintings on \"\"Las Meninas\"\" by Velasquez .\tHe began work on a large painting which he finished in 1907, called \"\"Les Desmoiselles d'Avignon\"\", which is recognised as the forerunner of Cubism.\tHe did, however, receive an honourable mention for his \"\"Science and Charity\"\" at the Madrid General Fine Arts Exhibition and also won a gold medal at the Malaga Provincial Exhibition.\tHe had been commissioned by the Republican Spanish government to produce a work for the Paris World Fair  and had not agreed, until the fascists bombed Guernica, the republican Basque town in northern Spain.\tHe influenced Klee.\tHe influenced his friend Leger Ford Madox Ford and Bretonpublished his work He was a pal of Hemingway, Pound, and RF Scott.\tHe knew Massine and sculptor Henry Moore.\tHe met

worked.\tHe supported the Republican cause in Spain and in 1937, as Franco's generals grew more repressive, he wrote a poem called \"\"Dream and Lie of Franco\"\", illustrating it with etchings depicting the horror of fascism.\tHe then had a period of what is known as Neo-classical Realism, using classical forms and drawing techniques inspired by Ingres and Renoir.\tHe then met Stein and her brother Leo, two Americans living in Paris,  who were the first serious collectors of French impressionists.\tHe travelled to Paris where he found a studio and a patron, art dealer Pere Manyac.\tHe was part of a group of artists and writers who met in a caf\u017d called Els Quatre Gats and who saw the Paris schools of art as their source of inspiration and knowledge.\tHe worked with de Falla.\tHis paintings at the time were sometimes Cubist and at other times naturalistic.\tIn 1899 he began working in a small studio owned by the painter Santiago Cardona, where he became known as Pablo Picasso rather than Pablo Ruiz.\tIn 1906, Picasso painted a portrait of Gertrude,  signalling yet another change of style thanks to the recent influence of an exhibition of primitive Iberian sculpture at the Louvre.\tIn 1907 the two painters expanded into producing collages and playing with the presentation of the objects they depicted.\tIn 1917 Picasso went to Rome with Cocteau to meet Diaghilev,  who ran the Ballets Russes.\tIn 1921, a son, Paulo, was born.\tIn 1931, he left Olga and went with Marie-Therese to live in the country at Boisgeloup.\tIn 1935 his daughter Maya was born and in 1936 he left Marie-Therese and moved back to Paris to live with Dora Maar, a Yugoslav photographer.\tIn 1946, Picasso and Gilot went to Vallauris in the Mediterranean, where they had two children, but she left him, taking the children with her, in 1953.\tIn 1961 he married Jacqueline Roque who worked in the pottery shop in Vallauris and spent the next twelve years toying with alternative art forms.\tIn June 1901, Manyac introduced him to the art dealer Ambroise Vollard who agreed to exhibit his work.\tIn the same year he painted one of his best known pictures, \"\"Weeping Woman\"\", a portrait of Maar.\tIn the summer he met the beautiful Fernande Olivier, who became his mistress,  and his Blue Period gave way to what is called his Rose Period.\tLater, together with the painter Charles Casagemas, he worked in a large studio for which Casagemas paid the rent.\tLe Corbusier^?\tNo gallery was allowed to exhibit his art, labelled degenerate by the Germans, but he was not in personal danger, as Arno Breker, Hitler's favourite sculptor, had warned the SS General Muller, that \"\"If you lay a hand on Picasso, the world's press will cause such an uproar you'll be left dizzy\"\".\tOne of his paintings was chosen for the Exposition Universelle in Paris.\tOver the next year, Picasso's met technique changed to Cubism, which he had developed with Braque.\tPicasso became filled with rage and despair and in the next two months, produced nearly two hundred drawings.\tPicasso continued his association with the ballet, producing, among others, the designs for Manuel de Falla's \"\"Three-Cornered Hat\"\" in 1919 and Igor Stravinsky^'s \"\"Pulcinella\"\" in 1920.\tPicasso himself later told the French writer Malraux that it was his first \"\"exorcism painting\"\" and was directly influenced by primitive art.\tPicasso met a young woman painter, Francoise Gilot, who became his mistress in 1943.\tPicasso now entered his Blue Period and Jacob soon took over from Manyac as his patron.\tPicasso studied the work of Toulouse-Lautrec and had his first exhibition at the caf\u017d in February 1900.\tPicasso was now mixing with an avant garde group led by the writer Cocteau, for whose production of \"\"Parade\"\" Picasso worked on the sets and costumes,  while Satie wrote the music.\tPicasso's art during the 1930s showed the influence of symbolism and he published the poetry \"\"Cahiers d'Art\"\"in 1935 and \"\"La Gaecta de Arte\"\" in 1936.\tPicasso's vast and varied output of work both mirrored the changes in artistic expression during the twentieth century and influenced its development.\tThe following year, he joined the Communist party and refused to help his old friend, Max Jacob, who was imprisoned and died on the way to the concentration camps.\tThe huge mural, \"\"Guernica\"\" was completed with Maar's help in under a month,  and became a symbol of the forces of oppression.\tThe work of Gauguin influenced this period of his work.\tThrough the exhibition, Picasso met and became friends with Max Jacob, who had come to Paris from Brittany, determined to be a poet and a painter.\tWhen he was thirteen, the family moved to
