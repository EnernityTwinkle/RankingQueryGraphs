William Jones ,  decided that Newton was the first to unify and make explicit what had been latent in the work of various forerunners.\tA constant preoccupation for Newton was the continuing fight with Leibniz over who first invented calculus.\tAlso at this time, Newton began to think about gravity.\tBarrow then resigned his Lucasian Professor's chair to make way for Newton.\tBetween 1665 and 1667, Newton made revolutionary advances in optics, physics, and astronomy, and laid the foundations for differential and integral calculus, several years before Leibniz's  discoveries.\tBoth objected to Newton's attempt to prove by experiment alone that light consisted of the motion of small particles.\tBy their application, Newton formulated the universal laws of nature with which he was able to solve virtually all the unsolved problems of his day.\tContemporary scientists believed that white light was a basic single entity, but the chromatic aberration seen in a telescope lens convinced Newton otherwise.\tDisappointed, he set aside his figures and did not return to them until about 12 years later.\tDuring his third year at Cambridge, Newton went beyond the compulsory study of Aristotle and read the works of Descartes , Gassendi , Hobbes , and 17th-century chemist Boyle .\tErasmus Bartholin's work questioned Newton's work on optics.\tFrom 1664, he recorded his thoughts in a notebook he called \"\"Certain Philosophical Questions\"\".\tHe admired the work of Oughtred.\tHe also said he thought light consisted of the motion of small particles, rather than waves.\tHe also was fascinated by the mechanics of Copernican astronomy as set out by Galileo and by Kepler's \"\"Optics\"\".\tHe assumed that the rate of fall is proportional to the force of gravity and that this force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth.\tHe met Romer.\tHe studied higher mathematics under Professor Isaac Barrow , who recognized Newton's genius and encouraged him.\tHe then worked out what the motion of the Moon would be if these assumptions were correct, but obtained a figure that was too low.\tHe wondered whether the force that pulled an apple to the ground could also pull the Moon into an orbit around the Earth.\tHis gravitational law declared that the force of gravity is proportional to the masses of the objects and decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between two bodies.\tHis laws of motion laid the basis for classical mechanics.\tHis theory of gravity was particularly important in working out the motions of the planets.\tHis work related to that of Algarotti, Gregory, Stevin,  'sGravesende  Haukesbee, Wallis, Johann Bernoulli, Stevin, Cavendish, Ferrel, Copernicus, Peiresc and William of Ockham.\tHowever, in 1692, the strain of his studies and his scientific disputes, especially with Leibniz, Flamsteed and Hooke, cast him into a severe depression and rumors spread that he had gone mad.\tIn 1669, Barrow decided the world must know about Newton's mathematical achievements and sent Newton's preliminary work, \"\"On Analysis by Infinite Series,\"\"  to John Collins in London.\tIn 1672, Newton published an account of his findings on white light in the Royal Society's \"\"Philosophical Transactions\"\".\tIn 1675, when Newton published another paper on the color phenomena in thin films, he annoyed Hooke again, this time because Hooke thought Newton had stolen some of his own optical results.\tIn 1689, Newton campaigned for a seat in Parliament and became Member for Cambridge.\tIn 1696, he was appointed Warden of the London Mint, becoming Master of the Mint in 1699.\tIn 1703, he was elected President of the Royal Society, an office he held until his death.\tIn 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne.\tIn a discussion of the shape of the orbit under the inverse square law of attraction towards a fixed center, Newton suggested the shape would be an ellipse, and promised to send Halley the calculation from which he had calculated the answer.\tIn the simple case of circular orbit, the law of attraction followed from Kepler's Third Law (relating the times of revolution of the planets around the sun to the sizes of their orbits) together with Huyghens's 1673 expression for the centripetal acceleration of a body moving in a circle.\tIn the summer of 1684, Halley visited Newton at Cambridge to discuss orbital dynamics.\tIn this paper, Newton demonstrated the existence of periodic optical phenomena: he had discovered concentric colored rings in the thin film of air between a lens and a flat sheet of glass and calculated that the distance between these concentric rings (\"\"Newton's rings\"\") depended on the thickness of the film of air.\tIt was acknowledged that though Leibniz's discoveries were later in time, he preceded Newton in publishing a full account.\tLate in 1679, Hooke wrote to Newton describing his analysis of planetary motion.\tNewton influenced Cheselden, Dalton, De Moivre, Maupertius, Buffon, Winthrop, Hales, Pieter van Musschenbroek and Whiston.\tNewton knew or worked with Tillotson, Sprat, Leeuwenhoek, Grew, Sloane and Arbuthnot.\tNewton turned his attention to the nature of light.\tNewton was given a state funeral and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\tNow obliged to deliver an annual course of lectures, Newton chose optics as his first subject.\tOne of the greatest scientists of all time.\tOver the next three years he summarized his findings in an essay, \"\"Of Colours\"\", which  became Book One of his \"\"Opticks\"\",  published in 1704.\tPassing a beam of sunlight through a prism, he observed that the beam spread into a colored band of light (spectrum), and from this he argued that sunlight is really a combination of all the colors.\tSoon after, he also found the missing link in the identification of the force of terrestrial gravity by discovering that a spherically-symmetrical distribution of matter exerts the same attraction at external points as if its mass were concentrated at its center.\tThe \"\"Principia\"\" contained Newton's three laws of motion (now known as Newton's Laws: laws of inertia, action and reaction, and acceleration proportional to force),  his theory of tides and lunar motion,  and his theory of gravitation as a universal law of attraction between any two objects.\tThe \"\"method of fluxions\"\", as he called it,  produced simple analytical methods that unified many existing techniques so as to solve problems like finding areas, tangents, the lengths of curves, and the maximums and minimums of functions.\tThe idea of a law of attraction according to the inverse square of the distance between the sun and the planets was now a topic of wide discussion in scientific circles.\tThe inverse problem of calculating the orbit from the law of force (which had baffled Hooke, Wren , Halley and others) was solved by Newton around 1680.\tThe paper provoked skepticism from the curator of the Royal Society, Hooke , and, on the Continent, from Christiaan Huyghens .\tThe physicist Brewster wrote his biography.\tThis led to an exchange between the two on the subject of elliptical orbits.\tThis tract, which over the next two years Newton expanded, formed the basis of the first book of \"\"Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica\"\" (\"\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"\") or the \"\"Principia\"\", as it commonly known.\tThree months later, Halley received a short tract, (\"\"On Motion\"\") which at Halley's request was registered with the Royal Society in early 1685.\tVoltaire remarked that England had honored a mathematician as other nations had honored a king.\tWhile in London, he met famous diarists Evelyn and Pepys and philosopher Locke .\tWith Halley's help, the \"\"Principia\"\" was published in 1687 and hailed as a masterpiece.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0,
