This I know.  I have been there many times,\u201d says Vashanka, lord of sack and pillage.  \u201cI have died before.\u201d\tAfter all the field of battle possesses many advantages over the drawing-room. There at least is no room for pretension or excessive ceremony, no shaking of hands or rubbing of noses, which make one doubt your sincerity, but hearty as well as hard hand-play. It at least exhibits one of the faces of humanity, the former only a mask.\tAnd Tempus thought then that nothing was more worthwhile than what was growing in this whitewashed barracks, where he has come to build a force such as men or gods have never seen -- a force worth reckoning with, if you were of a mind.  And something was of that mind.  And something else opposed it.  He should have expected that.  Battle in the heavens, battle on the earth.\tAnd what do the Theban hoplites see in this extended rending of the sky, this white-bright glory of Enlil's lightning?  The future, but not theirs:  paired cavalry fighters; formed ranks of armored death; grim men on their tall horses with lightning limning weapons tailored to the task; men spoiling for a fight if the gods allowed -- the Sacred Band of Stepsons, out from shadows and the dark.\tAny coward can fight a battle when he's sure of winning, but give me the man who has pluck to fight when he's sure of losing. That's my way, sir; and there are many victories worse than a defeat.\tEveryone prepares for battle in his own way.\tFrance has lost a battle. But France has not lost the war.\tIn a battle all you need to make you fight is a little hot blood and the knowledge that it's more dangerous to lose than to win.\tRevenge is never the best driver for a battle, but a common one.\tThe battle had shaken all three of them. Life seemed so fragile, each  Sacred Band fighter so vulnerable.\tThis was what men fought for, what men died for:  a chance at life, and to fight on other days -- the battle of your choice, of the body, or the heart, or the soul.\tWar consisteth not in battle only, or the act of fighting; but in a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known.\tWar seared its specter into your memory. Doubled the beat of your heart. Humbled you because it would take you if it could. Living had become very important, the only thing that mattered.\tWhen soldiers have been baptized in the fire of a battle-field, they have all one rank in my eyes.\tWisdom, Niko thought as he leaned his cheek against his long-handled rake, cannot be had without price. And that price is blood. The sound of it in your veins. The pound of it in your head. The volume of it in a human body; the sickness when you\u2019ve spilled it.\t\u200e\"\"Dreamers and dreaming dead, lots of them from neither here nor there with no chance of getting home again, lost in place and time...\"\"\t\u200e\"\"For Tempus...was a dozen storm gods' avatar; no army he sanctified could know defeat; no war he fought could not be won. Combat was life to him; he fought like the gods themselves...\"\"\t\u200e\"\"Gather the shards of your courage. Patch together what resolve you can. We'll find this thing -- and kill it.\"\"\t\u200e\"\"Then what difference does human striving make: mortal struggle, valor, pain? If you live, then live for the test of spirit, for the celebration of the heart. Live to fight on other days. Lose your beloveds one by one. And remember. Exalt the kiss of friend and horse and wind and sun, which venality cannot cheapen nor stupidity belittle.\"\"\t\u200eWhat doesn't bend must break, when dooms are apportioned and destiny takes the lead. As it will now, and as it must, until this struggle ends.\t\u201cThese Stepsons tread where mortals don\u2019t belong, some of us think.  They seek out battle high above their station.
