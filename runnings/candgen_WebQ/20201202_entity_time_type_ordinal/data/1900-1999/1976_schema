parasitologist Casimir-Joseph- Davaine) that anthrax was caused by micro-organisms found in the blood of infected sheep, Koch invented new techniques for culturing the organisms.\tBefore leaving India, he named village ponds as sources of local outbreaks of cholera and  isolated the cholera baccilus from one pond.\tDuring his army service he worked in a typhoid hospital and a hospital for the wounded.\tExcavating ancient Teutonic graves was a hobby pursued by many cultured men and in 1875 Koch found himself excavating alongside Virchow.\tFinally he succeeded in preparing a culture and isolating the tubercle bacillus in a variety of media.\tFollowing Henle's views on the causes of infectious diseases, Koch included bacteria in his microscopic studies and in 1873 began research into anthrax \u00ad a disease prevalent in the Wollstein district.\tHe also invented the hanging-drop technique of culturing micro-organisms in a drop of nutrient solution on the back of a glass slide.\tHe could then cut out pure bacterial cultures for use in experiments.\tHe discovered that using methylene blue on tissue samples stained with Bismarck brown made the bacillus more visible.\tHe established his own medical practice at Rakwitz in 1869 but when war broke out between France and Prussia in 1870 he volunteered as a field surgeon.\tHe led a team developing reliable procedures for cultivating pathogenic bacteria, isolating them and recording data.\tHe showed that the dried spores could remain dormant for years and then develop under the right conditions, showing why the disease could remain dormant for years.\tHe then took a succession of jobs in provincial hospitals, including one at Hamburg during a cholera outbreak.\tHe visited the lab of Almroth Wright.\tHe was taught by Meissner.\tHenle, an anatomist, had earlier (1840) suggested that contagious diseases were caused by living organisms.\tHis supporters failed to create a professorship of hygiene for Koch but in 1880 he was appointed government adviser to the Imperial Department of Health in Berlin.\tHis work was accepted by prominent surgeons such as Billroth in Europe, and the British surgeon Lister who had earlier introduced the concept and use of carbolic antisepsis.\tIn 1872 he became district surgeon at Wollstein (now in Poland).\tIn 1878 he published the results of his research into artificially induced infected wounds in animals,  showing that six different types of infection were each linked to a specific organism, and that the six organisms were both pathologically and were bacteriologically distinctive.\tIn 1881, Koch demonstrated his techniques in Lister's laboratory in London, where he also met the French bacteriologist Pasteur with whom he later quarrelled over Pasteur's immunisation claims for anthrax.\tIn 1883 Koch got permission to travel to India.\tIn a lecture to the Physiological Society in Berlin on 24 March 1882, Koch presented his findings.\tKoch also had the time to carry on with research and he set up his own laboratory.\tKoch is one of the founders of bacteriology and is remembered for his outstandingly significant discovery of the tubercle and cholera bacilli.\tKoch received the Nobel prize for his work on tuberculosis in 1905.\tKoch then used microphotography to record the structure of bacteria.\tKoch was now had a world-wide reputation and many foreign scientists and medical workers, such as the Dutch physician Eijkman, came to study under him.\tKoch was taught by the anatomist\u00b8Henle while studying medicine at Gottingen University and he later said it was Henle who inspired him to do scientific research.\tKoch's work on anthrax was the first real proof that a specific bacillus caused a specific disease.\tOn his return to Berlin Koch focussed on finding the origin of tuberculosis which was known to be an infectious disease.\tOn his return to Germany, his recommended control measures against cholera were adopted by the German empire.\tOver the next eight years he had time to follow up his interest in anthropology, a subject which had been popularized in Germany by the writings of Blumenthal.\tPaul Ehrlich developed a better method of staining for him, and the demonstration of the tubercle bacullus in sputum became a crucial diagnostic tool.\tThe tubercle bacillus was difficult to investigate because it was very small and its waxy coat made it resistant to staining.\tThese methods enabled him to describe the life cycle of the anthrax organism, as well as spore formation and germination.\tThis included dry-fixing films of bacterial culture on glass slides and then staining them with aniline dyes (according to information given him by Weigert).\tTo isolate and cultivate the organisms, Koch mixed them with nutrient gelatin which set to a solid medium in which the organisms could grow.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0,
