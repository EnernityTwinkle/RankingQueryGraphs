Lee was back in Texas and commissioned full colonel and commander of the First Cavalry on 16th March 1861.\tLee could only place his starving men in defensive lines in front of Petersburg and Richmond.\tLee finally saw active service, when he joined Major General Winfield Scott in January 1847, during the Mexican War of 1846 to 1848.\tLee himself was physically declining and frequently ill.\tLee succeeded in restoring the college as a model for higher education in the South.\tNow a Lieutenant Colonel, he left the Academy to take command of the Second Cavalry, with which he did several tours of duty in the South, especially in Texas and Mexico.\tOn 28th September 1870, Lee suffered what was probably a heart attack and died at daybreak on 12th October.\tOn 31st May, the leader of the Confederate troops opposing McClellan, General Johnston, was wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks, seven miles east of Richmond and Lee took over field command.\tOn April 18th he was called to Washington and offered command of a new army being formed to force the Confederate states back into the Union.\tOn the same day, Virginia seceded and Lee, out of loyalty to his family and homeland, resigned from the army after 36 years of service.\tRobert Edward Lee was born on the Stratford estate in Westmoreland County, Virginia, the son of Ann Hill Carter and Henry \"\"Light Horse Harry\"\" Lee,  a famous cavalry leader during the American Revolution and Governor of Virginia from 1792 to 1795.\tThe month before, Texas had become the seventh Southern state to secede from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America and, with the rest of the Union forces, he was ordered out of the state.\tThere, Lee courted Custis' daughter, Mary Anne Randolph Custis, whom he was to marry two years later.\tThis action had the strategic advantage of diverting essential troops from Army of the Potomac Major General McClellan's offensive against Richmond, the Confederate capital.\tWithin three weeks Lee had organized Confederate troops into what became the famed Army of Northern Virginia.\tWorking independently of Davis, however, Lee introduced a coherent strategy into the Confederate army,  and was able to reinforce Major General 'Stonewall' Jackson's army sufficiently to undertake a surprise attack on Federal troops in the Shenandoah Valley, 8th May-9th June 1862.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.06f5j", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

Washburne, the congressman for Galena.\tGrant remained with his regiment until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, yielding half of Mexico to the United States, was ratified in the spring of 1848.\tGrant saw military action during the Mexican War of 1846-48, first under General Zachary Taylor, then under General Winfield Scott, as regimental quartermaster.\tGrant then led the most brilliant action of the war, despite the opposition of his subordinates, including that of his right-hand man, General William T. Sherman.\tGrant then settled down as a private citizen in New York City, where he bought a house in 1881 and invested his life savings with the firm Grant and Ward, in which his son Ulysses, Jr., was a partner.\tGrant tried several business and farming ventures to supplement his army pay, but he could not afford to reunite his family.\tGrant was now a national hero and Congress revived the grade of lieutenant general, last held by George Washington, so that Lincoln could appoint him general in chief of all Union armies.\tGrant was stationed at army bases in Sackets Harbor,  New York and Detroit, from 1848 to 1852.\tGreeley opposed him WTG Morton served under him He met Emperor Franz Josef.\tHe distinguished himself at the battle of Chatulpec on 13th September 1847, earning brevet commissions as first lieutenant and captain.\tHe learned that he had incurable throat cancer and, in order to pay off his debts and support his family after his death, he signed a contract with his friend Twain to publish the memoirs and resolved to complete them before he died.\tHe returned home to popular demand that he run for a third term, to which he unwisely succumbed, but was defeated by ballot.\tHe then returned to St. Louis, where, on 22nd August, he married Julia Dent, with whom he had four children.\tHis appointment as general was supported by editorial in Bryant's paper Bought clothes at Wanamaker's.\tHis death on 23rd July 1885, in Mount McGregor, in the Adirondacks, where the Grant family had moved the month before, came just days after he had completed the final chapter.\tIn 1839, Grant was sent to the US Military Academy at West Point and was enrolled, mistakenly, as Ulysses Simpson Grant, the name he adopted.\tIn 1866, Grant was appointed to the newly established rank of General of the Armies of the United States, but his increasing concern about southern Democratic violence, against freed slaves, Unionists and Federal troops, was moving him politically towards the Republican programme of Radical Reconstruction.\tIn 1877 Grant finally left office and the family went on a two-year round the world tour.\tIn 1884 the firm collapsed and left Grant in debt.\tIn August 1853, he was promoted captain and transferred to Fort Humboldt, California.\tIn February 1868, when Congress, under the Tenure of Office Act, insisted on Stanton's reinstatement, Grant infuriated Johnson by resigning, yielding the office to Stanton.\tIn January 1862, Grant received permission from General Henry Wager Halleck to begin an offensive campaign.\tIn July 1852, Grant was forced to leave his family behind when he was transferred to Fort Vancouver, Oregon Territory.\tIn order to make money, in 1884 and 1885 Grant began to write about his campaigns for the 'Century Magazine', then began to prepare his memoirs.\tIn the spring of 1864, Grant headquartered with the Army of the Potomac, whose offensive against Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, would prove to be the decisive action in determining the outcome of the war By mid-June Lee was pinned down at Petersburg, near Richmond, while Sherman's army was marching through Georgia and cavalry forces under General Philip Sheridan destroyed railroads and supplies in Virginia.\tIt led to the surrender of Vicksburg on 4th July 1863 and, four days later, that of the Confederacy's only remaining fort on the Mississippi at Port Hudson.\tJohnson suspended Secretary of War Stanton in August 1867 and Grant accepted the position of interim secretary to stop the appointment of a more conservative man.\tOften ranked as one of the worst American presidents, his great service to the nation was the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment.\tOn 2nd April 1865, after nine months of stalemate in the trenches, Lee was forced to abandon Petersburg and surrender on 9th April, at Appomattox Court House, marking, in effect, the end of the Civil War.\tOn April 11, 1854, Grant resigned from the army.\tOn March 4th 1869, at the age of 46 Grant was youngest man yet elected President.\tOne of his major successes was the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, banning racial discrimination in voting rights.\tThese victories prompted Grant to advance towards Vicksburg, the strongest remaining Confederate position, linking the eastern and western halves of the Confederacy and blocking Union control of the Mississippi River.\tThis action cemented Grant's Republican ties and ensured his nomination for president in 1868.\tWith the Confederacy cut in half, Grant had opened the whole river to Union shipping.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.07t2k", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
