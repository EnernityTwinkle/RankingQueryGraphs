{"p": 0.0, "r": 0.0, "f1": 0, "ans_size": 33, "hops": 1, "ans_str": "At the Protestant University of T\u0178bingen  Kepler studied theology, philosophy, and mathematics (under the astronomer Maestlin, who introduced him to Copernicus' work.   Kepler intended to become a Lutheran minister, and after graduating in 1591, started a three-year programme of theological training. Kepler's theological studies were interrupted in 1594, when he was nominated by his tutors for a teaching post in mathematics and astronomy at the Academy in Graz (now in Austria)  where he stayed for four years, and began to concentrate on both astrology (he remained a believer in astrology until his death) and astronomy, working with Maestlin on optics and planetary orbits.\tDemonstrating that the five 'Platonic Solids': i.e. the only regular polyhedrons (the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) could be fitted sequentially inside a series of spheres to form a \"\"nest\"\" which reproduced ( with the exception of Mercury)  the scale of distances of the planets from the Sun, Kepler showed how the planetary orbits fitted between these spheres.\tDuring the years following Brahe's death, Kepler, assisted by the Swiss mathematician and inventor Burgi, spent much time attempting to fit the apparent positions of the planet Mars, as observed by Tycho, to the various cosmologies (of Ptolemy, Brahe, and Copernicus).\tDuring this work he identified the elliptical orbit of Mars, and developed the planetary laws named after him.\tHe studied the work of ben Gershom.\tHis astronomy was followed up by Borelli.\tHis first  astronomical work, 'Mysterium Cosmographicum' (1596), attmepted to fit planetary orbits to Copernican theory.\tHis new astronomy provided the basis for Newton's work.\tHis next work was 'The Harmony of the World' (1619), an almost mystical text (giving an all-embracing synthesis of geometry, music, astrology,  and astronomy) in the fifth book of which is buried the last of his planetary laws.\tHis three Laws of Motion are considered to be the basis of our understanding of the Solar System.\tHis work influenced Leibniz  and (with the camera obscura) Cheselden.\tHis work related to that of  Toscanelli, ^work related to^ Al Battani, ^work related to^ ^Hobbes^, Andreae and the Cassini family His biography was written by Brewster.\tIn 1588 a purge of Protestants forced him to leave Graz for a month, but in 1599 (the year the Italian philosopher and scientist Bruno was burned at the stake in Rome for his belief in the same Copernican system) Kepler was again expelled, and in January 1600 arrived in Prague where Brahe, much impressed with the originality and boldness displayed in his book, invited him to work as his assistant at Benatky Castle,  near Prague.\tIn 1597 he sent copies to several leading astronomers, including Galileo and Brahe.\tIn 1609  he produced: 'A New Astronomy, or A Physics of the Stars', which included an explanation of two of his three planetary laws.\tIn 1612, on Emperor Rudolph's death, he accepted the job of District Mathematician at Linz, Austria, where he was to spent the next 15 years.\tIn 1619, he gave a copy of 'The Harmony' to the visiting English poet  Donne to deliver to King James I of England, to whom the work was dedicated.\tInfluenced by della Mirandola and Witelo.\tKepler also showed that the orbital velocity of a planet is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the Sun.\tKepler also suggested that the Sun itself rotates (confirmed by observing the sunspots discovered by Galileo).\tKepler served as Brahe's assistant for 22 months until Brahe's death in 1601, during which time his genius became apparent to visiting astronomers, including Snell.\tKepler stayed in Prague from 1600-12.\tKepler then worked for nine years to complete his crowning achievement in practical astronomy:- the Rudolphine Tables of planetary positions, based on Brahe's observations and Kepler's new laws.\tKepler was again forced to move as a result of political upheaval caused by the Thirty Years' War, and in 1626 he settled in Ulm, Germany,  where he remained for the next two years, finally publishing the Rudolphine Tables in 1627.\tKepler's Third Law describes in precise mathematical language the link between the distances of the planets from the Sun and their velocities:- that the square of the time of a planet's periodic revolution is proportional to the  cube of its mean distance from the Sun.\tKepler's second major work to be published at Linz, the 'Epitome of Copernican Astronomy' (1618-21), intended by the author as an introduction to Copernican astronomy, is in fact a summary of Kepler's entire work in theoretical astronomy, and describes a Solar System essentially the same as the one we know today.\tMeanwhile, in 1604, his attention was diverted from the planets by his observation of the appearance of a new star (\"\"Kepler's nova\"\") and the same year he published his: 'The Optical Part of Astronomy', in which he explained the principles of atmospheric refraction, spectacle lenses and his improved camera obscura (first used by the 11th-century mathematician and physicist Al Hazen and the forerunner of the photographic camera), and gave the modern explanation of the workings of the eye.\tThe First Law states that planets travel in elliptical rather than circular orbits, and that the Sun is at one of the two foci of the ellipses.\tThe Second Law states that the line joining the Sun and a planet crosses equal areas of space in equal periods of time, so that the planets move more quickly when they are nearer the Sun.\tThese tables enabled the calculation of the positions of the planets at any time in the past, present or future, and included a map of the world, a catalog of stars, and the latest aid to computation: logarithms (originally developed by his assistant at Prague, Burgi, independently of  John Napier in Scotland).\tThis established the Sun as the source of the attractive force (Kepler called it \"\"Holy Spirit force\"\")  governing the orbits of the planets.\tThis was Kepler's largest work - published in seven books over four years - and proved to be the most important systematic exposition of astronomy since Ptolemy's 'Almagest', with more impact than any other astronomical text of the mid-17th century.\tWithin a few days of Brahe's death, Kepler was appointed Imperial Mathematician, the most prestige appointment in mathematics in Europe,  for the rest of his life.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0403d", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
