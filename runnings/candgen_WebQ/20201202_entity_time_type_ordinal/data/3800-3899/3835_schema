Crawford, none of whom had a clear majority of votes after the election.\tJohn Quincy used Spain's embarrassment over these incidents as bargaining points in negotiating the Transcontinental Treaty with Spain, which granted ownership of East and West Florida to the United States, and established the boundary between the United States and Mexico.\tLater, he succesfully negotiated joint ownership of the Oregon Territory with England, and was instrumental in formulating the policies of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the countries of the Americas were sovereign from any European power, that the United States would support the newly-recognized Latin American countries against any future colonization by European powers, and would protect the rights of those countries against European invasion, while at the same time reaffirming that the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs.\tLater, he was appointed Minister to England from 1815 to 1817.\tOne of America's greatest politicians, instrumental in creating American foreign policy that set the standard for United States involvement in world affairs into the 20th Century.\tPresident James K. Polk used the precedent set by this Doctrine in 1845 when he declared that the United States should have full control of the Oregon Territory, and when warning European nations not to interfere in the disputes with Mexico that resulted in the Mexican War of 1846-1848.\tSamuel Adams, a cousin, also served as a member of the Continental Congress.\tSmithson died in 1829, the last year of John Quincy's presidency, but it wasn't until 1846 that Robert Dale Owen opened House debate on what to do with the bequest.\tThat year, the House passed legislation which established the Smithsonian Instutition.\tWashington was so pleased with John Quincy's work, that when John Adams was elected President after him in 1797, he wrote to the elder Adams expressing the hope that Adams would continue to employ John Quincy as a diplomat abroad.\tWashington, the first President of the United States, made John Quincy his Minister to the Netherlands in 1794.\tWebster also wrote the first American grammar book, the \"\"Blue-Backed Speller,\"\" which Benjamin Franklin, another friend of John Adams, read to his granddaughter.\tWhen President James Monroe was elected in 1817, he brought John Quincy back to the United States from Europe, and made him his Secretary of State, a position John Quincy held through both of Monroe's terms.\tWhen war broke out between England and America in 1812, John Quincy was sent to the peace negotiations in Ghent to replace Alexander Hamilton as the American representative.\tWhile in Russia, John Quincy reported on events in Europe, including Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and eventual retreat.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.03_nq", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
