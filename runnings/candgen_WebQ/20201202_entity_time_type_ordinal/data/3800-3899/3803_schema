Hayward, whom he hired to work for  him.\tIn 1839, after five years of intensive experimentation, Goodyear accidentally dropped a rubber sample that had been mixed with sulphur and litharge (lead oxide) on a hot stove.\tIn 1855 Goodyear travelled to France,  where he organized a large exhibit on his work for the Exposition  Universelle in Paris for which Napoleon III awarded him the Grand Medal  of Honor and the Cross of the Legion d'Honneur, but in the same year a  French company that manufactured vulcanized rubber by his process failed,  and in December 1855 Goodyear was imprisoned in the Paris debtors' prison.\tIn 1859 he moved to Washington D.C.\tMeanwhile, having read of and experimented with Goodyear's  process, in November 1843 Thomas Hancock was granted an English patent for vulcanization, depriving Goodyear of all profits from the English manufacture of rubber.\tPerkin discovered mauve in 1856, which led to the foundation of the aniline dye industry,  used in the manufacture of rubber tyres.\tThe chemical reaction of rubber and sulphur at a high temperature which followed, transformed the rubber into a stable, versatile commercial product with hundreds of uses.\tThe modern rubber industry had been originated in 1820 by the English coachmaker and inventor Hancock, who opened the world's first  rubber factory in London, England, and was for a time in partnership with Charles Macintosh.\tThe term \"\"vulcanization\"\" was coined in England by Thomas Hancock's friend,  William Brockedon - after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and metalworking -  and Goodyear adopted it in his  patents and writings.\tTwelve years later, the rubber industry arrived in the  United States, when the India Rubber Company of Roxbury, MA began  manufacturing rubber bottles, raincoats, and overshoes.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.01_02r", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
