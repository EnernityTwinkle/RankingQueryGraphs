Although he had taught himself Latin, the language of scholarship, he wrote in the Italian vernacular.\tHe finished none of his treatises, but continued to draw with undiminished imagination and power for his  \"\"Visions of the End of the World\"\" series until he died at Cloux in 1519.\tHe is one of the people credited with inventing the ^possibly invented^ camera obscura^ He was influenced by Della Francesca, Masaccio, Toscanelli  and Witelo Lorenzo de'Medici was a patron.\tHe recorded the flight of birds.\tHe was influenced by artists such as Uccello, who made perspective studies, and by contemporary thinkers like mathematician Pacioli, who, when they met in 1496, was writing a treatise on proportion.\tHe was treated as a revered authority, given a pension, and was asked to advise on architectural matters and, in particular, on the governor's plan to build a canal to link Milan with Lake Como.\tHe worked on fortifications, canals and other architectural projects.\tHe worked with ^worked with^ Bramante.\tHired as engineer and architect in charge of fortification, Da Vinci traveled with Borgia on his campaigns, surveying the vanquished Italian territories.\tHis notebooks were a dazzling display of thought, observation, and beautiful drawings.\tHis scientific imagination, his drawings and notebooks have inspired both artists and scientists through the centuries.\tHis work influenced that of Alberti, Durer, Signorelli, Rubens  and Tartaglia.\tHis work related to that of Veronese.\tIn 1482, Da Vinci joined the court of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, where he was employed as painter, sculptor, designer, technical consultant for architectural and military matters, and hydraulic and mechanical engineer.\tIn 1502, Da Vinci entered the employ of Borgia, the illegitimate son of  Pope Alexander VI.\tIn 1503, he was commissioned to paint a mural of a battle scene in the new council chamber of Florence's Palazzo Vecchio.\tIn 1506, Da Vinci was called to Milan by the French governor.\tIn Florence, in 1500, his cartoon for a painting of the \"\"Virgin and Child with St. Anne\"\" was widely praised for the originality of its composition and the profound emotion it evoked.\tIn his studio, Da Vinci and his pupils worked on a version of \"\"The Virgin of the Rocks\"\" and also on two paintings he had brought from Florence:  the \"\"Virgin and Child with St. Anne\"\" and  \"\"Leda\"\".\tKnew Cardano family.\tOne of his pupils was Francesco Melzi, a young nobleman, who became his close companion for the rest of his life.\tRecognized as a genius, with immense energy and limitless curiosity which both fed and dissipated his extraordinary gifts.\tThe statue was to have been cast in bronze soon after, but war threatened and the metal was diverted to military use.\tThe subject was \"\"The Battle of Anghiari\"\", a 1440 encounter in which cavalry from Florence and the Papacy had defeated the Milanese.\tThey have influenced thinkers, scientists and artists through the centuries.\tThough a brilliant painter, he left only a small body of pictorial work.\tTo put in the time, he continued his studies and technical experiments, volunteered to help on a project to reclaim land, and made sketches for a Medici house in Florence.\tToward the end of the 15th century, now in his late 40's, Da Vinci published a book on the theory of mechanics with precise drawings of the elements of mechanics, such as screws, jacks and gears.\tVenturi wrote about his work.\tWhen French troops entered Milan in September, 1499, the Duke  fled and Leonardo, now without a patron, made his way to Mantua, where he painted Isabella d'Este's portrait.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.04lg6", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
