Simple people imagine that they should see God as if he stood there and they here. This is not so. God and I, we are one in knowledge.\tThe knowledge of an unlearned man is living and luxuriant like a forest, but covered with mosses and lichens and for the most part inaccessible and going to waste; the knowledge of the man of science is like timber collected in yards for public works, which still supports a green sprout here and there, but even this is liable to dry rot.\tThe long unmeasured pulse of time moves everything. There is nothing hidden that it cannot bring to light, nothing once known that may not become unknown.\tThe next best thing to knowing something is knowing where to find it.\tThe specialist is one who never makes small mistakes while moving toward the grand fallacy.\tThe things we know best are the things we haven't been taught.\tThe trouble with most folks ain't so much their ignorance as knowing so many things that ain't so.\tThe trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that ain't so.\tThe use of knowledge in our sex (beside the amusement of solitude) is to moderate the passions and learn to be contented with a small expense, which are the certain effects of a studious life and, it may be, preferable even to that fame which men have engrossed to themselves and will not suffer us to share.\tThere are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating --people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.\tThere are three principal means of acquiring knowledge available to us: observation of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of that combination. Our observation of nature must be diligent, our reflection profound, and our experiments exact. We rarely see these three means combined; and for this reason, creative geniuses are not common.\tThere is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.\tThere is no knowledge, no light, no wisdom that you are in possession of, but what you have received it from some source.\tThere is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning. There is, my friend, only a knowledge -- that is everywhere.\tThere's a theory, one I find persuasive, that the quest for knowledge is, at bottom, the search for the answer to the question: Where was I before I was born. In the beginning was what? Perhaps, in the beginning, there was a curious room, a room like this one, crammed with wonders; and now the room and all it contains are forbidden you, although it was made just for you, had been prepared for you since time began, and you will spend all your life trying to remember it.\tThey are so knowing, that they know nothing.\tTo despise our own species is the price we must often pay for knowledge of it.\tTo know all is not to forgive all. It is to despise everybody.\tTo know is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge.\tTo know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.\tTo know the right means of getting something done is virtually to have done it.\tTo know yet to think that one does not know is best; Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.\tTo succeed in business, to reach the top, an individual must know all it is possible to know about that business.\tToday knowledge has power. It controls access to opportunity and advancement.\tTrue knowledge lies in knowing how to live.\tTrue scholarship consists in knowing not what things exist, but what they mean; it is not memory but judgment.\tVague and mysterious forms of speech, and abuse of language, have so long passed for mysteries of science; and hard or misapplied words with little or no meaning have, by prescription, such a right to be mistaken for deep learning and height of speculation, that it will not be easy to persuade either those who speak or those who hear them, that they are but the covers of ignorance and hindrance of true knowledge.\tWe are in fact convinced that if we are ever to have pure knowledge of anything, we must get rid of the body and contemplate things by themselves with the soul by itself. It seems, to judge from the argument, that the wisdom which we desire and upon which we profess to have set our hearts will be attainable only when we are dead and not in our lifetime.\tWe don't know one-millionth of one percent about anything.\tWe have no organ at all for knowledge, for truth: we know (or believe or imagine) precisely as much as may be useful in the interest of the human herd, the species: and even what is here called usefulness is in the end only a belief, something imagined and perhaps precisely that most fatal piece of stupidity by which we shall one day perish.\tWe have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has, because we know how it is made. We have lost as much as we gained by prying into that matter.\tWe own almost all our knowledge not to those who have agreed but to those who have differed.\tWhat is not fully understood is not possessed.\tWhen you cease to strive to understand, then you will know without understanding.\tWhen you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it--this is knowledge.\tWhen you see the abyss, and we have looked into it, then what? There isn't much room at the edge -- one person, another, not many. If you are there, others cannot be there. If you are there, you become a protective wall. What happens? You become part of the abyss.\tWhere is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?  Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?\tWhere is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information.\tWho knows most believes least.\tWisdom, Niko thought as he leaned his cheek against his long-handled rake, cannot be had without price.\tWithout knowledge, life is not more than the shadow of death.\tWithout wisdom, knowledge is either useless or destructive.\tYou can't know too much, but you can say too much.\t\u201cAt its most dynamic, faith evolves into powerful applicable knowledge.\u201d\t\u201cCareful studies of cases dealing with supposed \u2018mental disorder\u2019 have at times revealed that many thought to be insane or warped in some fashion were actually simply highly sensitive individuals.

including Frederick the Greatof Prussia and, in 1698, he demonstrated circulation in the capillaries of an eel to Peter the Great of Russia.\tThe first known drawing of bacteria made by Leeuwenhoek appeared in the Royal Society's 'Philosophical Transactions' in 1683.\tThe following year, in 1674, Leeuwenhoek made arguably his most important contribution to science, his discovery of the existence of micro-organisms, which he called 'animalcules' found in rainwater, pond and well-water, as well as the human mouth and intestine.\tThese findings made Leeuwenhoek instantly well-known, inspiring scientists such as Leibniz to visit Delft (1676),  or to take up microscopical research themselves.\tThis was a sensational scientific development, and when he communicated his findings to the Royal Society in October 1676 they were first met with disbelief.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0bj_v", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
