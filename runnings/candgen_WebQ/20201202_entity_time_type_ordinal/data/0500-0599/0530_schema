If you win, you are the powerful kings prisoner, and wise princes avoid as much as they can being in other mens power.\tGod is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.\tHatred is gained as much by good works as by evil.\tI consider it a mark of great prudence in a man to abstain from threats or any contemptuous expressions, for neither of these weaken the enemy, but threats make him more cautious, and the other excites his hatred, and a desire to revenge himself.\tIt is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.\tIt should be noted that when he seizes a state the new ruler ought to determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. He should inflict them once and for all, and not have to renew them every day.\tMany have dreamed up republics and principalities that have never in truth been known to exist; the gulf between how one should live and how one does live is so wide that a man who neglects what is actually done for what should be done learns the way to self-destruction rather than self-preservation.\tMen are more apt to be mistaken in their generalizations than in their particular observations.\tMen in general judge more by the sense of sight than by the sense of touch, because everyone can see, but only a few can test by feeling. Everyone sees what you seem to be, few know what you really are, and those few do not dare take a stand against the general opinion.\tMen in general judge more from appearances than from reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration.\tMen nearly always follow the tracks made by others and proceed in their affairs by imitation, even though they cannot entirely keep to the tracks of others or emulate the prowess of their models. So a prudent man should always follow in the footsteps of great men and imitate those who have been outstanding. If his own prowess fails to compare with theirs, at least it has an air of greatness about it. He should behave like those archers who, if they are skilful, when the target seems too distant, know the capabilities of their bow and aim a good deal higher than their objective, not in order to shoot so high but so that by aiming high they can reach the target.\tMen shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear.\tMen sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.\tNo one should be astonished if in the following discussion of completely new princedoms and of the prince and of government, I bring up the noblest examples. Because, since men almost always walk in the paths beaten by others and carry on their affairs by imitatingeven though it is not possible to keep wholly in the paths of others or to attain the ability of those you imitatea prudent man will always choose to take paths beaten by great men and to imitate those who have been especially admirable, in order that if his ability does not reach theirs, at least it may offer some suggestion of it; and he will act like prudent archers, who, seeing that the mark they plan to hit is too far away and knowing what space can be covered by the power of their bows, take an aim much higher than their mark, not in order to reach with their arrows so great a height, but to be able, with the aid of so high an aim, to attain their purpose.\tOf mankind we may say in general they are fickle, hypocritical, and greedy of gain.\tOne change always leaves the way open for the establishment of others.\tPrinces and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within society.\tSince it is difficult to join them together, it is safer to be feared than to be loved when one of the two must be lacking.\tStates that rise quickly, just as all the other things of nature that are born and grow rapidly, cannot have roots and ramifications; the first bad weather kills them.\tTardiness often robs us opportunity, and the dispatch of our forces.\tThe fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.\tThe main foundations of every state, new states as well as ancient or composite ones, are good laws and good arms you cannot have good laws without good arms, and where there are good arms, good laws inevitably follow.\tThe one who adapts his policy to the times prospers, and likewise that the one whose policy clashes with the demands of the times does not.\tThe promise given was a necessity of the past: the word broken is a necessity of the present.\tThe wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing; and when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs, they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.\tThere are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself, the other appreciates what others can understand, the third understands neither for itself nor through others. This first kind is excellent, the second good, and the third kind useless.\tThere is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.\tThere is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\tWhere the willingness is great, the difficulties cannot be great.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 3, "m.05cvs", ["people.person.quotations"]]]}

his past loyalties, Macchiavelli was given no position by the new rulers and he died, in Florence, in the same year.\tCesare Borgia had embarked on a military campaign to grab as much of the Romagna area as he could,  in order to form his own state in the center of Italy.\tChancery employees were often sent abroad on missions thought to be too sensitive for ordinary ambassadors and, in 1500, he went to the French to encourage them to honor their agreement to help Florence regain Pisa.\tDespite this, he was impressed by the loyalty of Borgia's soldiers, contrasted with the mutiny of the Swiss mercenaries Florence had employed at Pisa.\tGuilio became Pope Clement VII in 1523 and Macchiavelli was back in power.\tHe also read widely and conversed with scholars like Trissino.\tHe dedicated the book to Lorenzo de'Medici, the ruler of Florence, in an unsuccessful bid to get back into favor.\tHe influenced Naude.\tHe retired to a small property at Sant'Andrea in Percussina outside Florence and began writing his \"\"Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy\"\", a treatise on Republics.\tHe returned to France in 1511, in an attempt to persuade the king to remove the French-supported council in Pisa.\tHe then wrote \"\"The Mandrake\"\" in 1518, a dark satire on the corruption of the clergy and the evil in men In 1520, he took a job as official historian of the Republic at the University of Florence and wrote to Pope Leo X, advising him to restore the Republic's freedom.\tHe was also made Secretary to the Magistracy, which was responsible for foreign affairs and defence.\tHe was involved with a project by Da Vinci.\tHe was obviously a good learner because, in 1498, at the age of twenty-nine, he was given the key government post of Head of the Second Chancery, dealing with government affairs in the Republic of Florence.\tHe was so impressed he wrote an account titled: \"\"On the Manner Adopted by the Duke. to Kill Vitellozzo\"\".\tIn 1504 Macchiavelli wrote the poem \"\"Annals of Italy\"\" and a play based on Aristophanes satirizing various leading religious and political figures.\tIn 1505, when he succeeded in getting a law passed to establish a militia, the Florentine Republic's territory was divided up into districts,  levies were set, and Macchiavelli was made Secretary of the Council with authority over the militia.\tIn 1526, he was appointed secretary of a committee set up to oversee the fortifications of Florence being undertaken by Pietro Navarra, a famous military engineer and Spanish refugee.\tIn 1527, Rome was sacked, Florence captured and the Medicis driven out of power.\tIn France Macchiavelli recognized the immense power that could be wielded by a strong central authority.\tItaly was at war with the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and Macchiavelli was in service with the Italian army.\tLater, against the wishes of fellow members of the Council, Macchiavelli mobilized the militia in a successful campaign against Pisa and, in 1510, he went to France again to try to avert war between France and the Papal States.\tMacchiavelli found Borgia to be the ultimate bold, energetic and respected leader of his soldiers, characteristics which Macchiavelli later described in his book on statecraft:  \"\"The Prince\"\".\tMacchiavelli had more dealings with Borgia and in 1502, when Borgia tricked his enemies at Senigallia and then had them killed, Macchiavelli recognised the logic of the action and commended Borgia's decisiveness.\tMacchiavelli then witnessed the fall of Borgia, who now lacked Papal support,  and his admiration for Cesare slowly turned to contempt.\tMacchiavelli was dismissed from his job.\tMacchiavelli was the first to base a political theory on the study of human nature.\tMacchiavelli's father, a doctor of law, was an undischarged bankrupt, so Macchiavelli was largely self-taught with occasional help from tutors.\tPope Julius II then demanded that the Florentines join the League against France but they refused.\tReturning to Italy, Macchiavelli himself removed the council.\tSix months later, he returned to an Italy that was in political chaos.\tStimulated by his research, in 1513 he also wrote his most famous work, \"\"The Prince,\"\" a book on the principles of statecraft.\tThe Florentines,  feeling themselves threatened sent a group for talks with Boria.\tThe Pope died in 1521, before he could reply,  but Giulio de'Medici asked for advice and Macchiavelli sent him a revised version of the letter.\tThe following year, he was imprisoned and tortured for plotting to overthrow the Medicis but he was eventually released.\tThe team included Macchiavelli, who managed to keep discussions going until French troops arrived in the Republic.\tThere was panic in the city as Spanish troops approached and, by 1512, the exiled Medici faction had seized power in Florence.\tTwo years later, the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, threatened to invade Italy, and Florence sent Macchiavelli to Germany to report on his strengths and weaknesses.\tWhen he returned to Florence, he was sure that they would be drawn into any conflict between the Pope and the French king and did everything he could to strengthen the militia.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 3, "m.05cvs", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
