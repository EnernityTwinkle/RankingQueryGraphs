Wells in 1921.\tHowever, a government informer soon infiltrated the group, and in December 1895 the leaders of the Union were arrested.\tHowever, his health had been in decline since an assassination attempt in 1918, and in late 1922 he suffered a serious stroke.\tIn 1902, however, the owner of the Munich printing plant refused to produce any more copies of 'Iskra', so Lenin moved to London, where he met an important future collaborator, Trotsky, and published probably his most important work: 'What is to be done?' The work created significant divisions between many of his close allies, particularly his conception of a highly disciplined centralized party that would, presumably under his leadership, lead the proletariat to revolution.\tIn 1921 he worked out a plan for the construction of socialism and developed the principles of his New Economic Policy, which emphasized economic reconstruction and education, and allowed a limited amount of free enterprise in order to give Russia respite before entering the era of giant state planning.\tIn August 1893, Lenin moved to St. Petersburg where he nominally practised as a public defender, but concentrated most of his efforts on developing links with other revolutionary Marxists, one of whom was his future wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya.\tIn December 1907, Lenin was forced to flee from the Tsar's secret police, and he remained abroad for the next decade, studying works by political, military and industrial theorists (from Clausewitz's 'On War', 1832-34 to Taylor's 'Principles of Scientific Management', 1911), while developing and promoting the cause of a Russian Bolshevik revolution.\tIn June 1905 the famous Potemkin naval revolt took place, by October there was a general strike, and in mid-October the Tsar felt compelled to grant certain civil liberties and to establish a Duma (parliament).\tIn March 1895 Lenin developed pneumonia, but a month later had sufficiently recovered to leave Russia for Switzerland, where he intended to make contact with Russian political exiles.\tLenin concluded peace with Germany in 1918, and then commanded the Bolsheviks in the ensuing civil war (1918-21), during which he fought off both the White Army and foreign intervention, despite the anarchy and widespread starvation afflicting Russia.\tLenin produced the newspaper, printed secretly and then smuggled into Russia, in the hope that its message would unify and strengthen the disparate Russian revolutionary movements.\tLenin studied revolutionary political literature favoured by his brother, including the work of  Moses Hess, and  Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital'  and became committed to Marxism.\tLenin was jailed for 14 months in an open prison from where he continued to correspond with revolutionaries, engineer strikes and walk-outs, and began writing his first major work, 'The Development of Capitalism in Russia.' In February 1897, Lenin was exiled to Siberia for three years, where he was joined by his fianc\u017de, Nadezhda Krupskaya, whom he married in July 1898.\tLenin was then elected head of the Soviet Government, and on 11 March 1918, together with the Party Central Committee and the Soviet Government, he moved to Moscow, which then became the capital of the Soviet state.\tMeanwhile Lenin, who had vigorously opposed the war as an imperialist struggle between competing groups of capitalists that should in Russia be converted into civil war, had managed to persuade officials in the German government that, should he come to power, he would withdraw Russia from the war.\tMeanwhile, Lenin had returned to Russia in October and took charge of the Bolsheviks, but he remained convinced that the time for revolution had not yet come.\tMeanwhile, Russia remained at war and as morale worsened, Lenin - supported by Trotsky (now his second-in-command), Stalin and Molotov - developed a plan for the proletariat to seize power by means of an armed uprising.\tMeanwhile, in Russia conditions were worsening, with resentment against Tsar Nicholas II and the government made worse by Russian losses in the Russo-Japanese War.\tMoving from  Finland (1906), to Geneva (1908), where he established another newspaper, 'Proletary' ('The Proletarian'), and then Paris (1909), where two years later he set up a school for the training of underground revolutionaries, in 1910 Lenin met the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky in Capri, who became an important supporter and sponsor of the Bolsheviks In 1916 Lenin moved to Zurich.\tOn release from his exile in 1900, Lenin travelled to Pskov and from there into self-imposed exile in western Europe where, in association with Russian Marxists abroad, he was to spend the next five years devoting himself to revolutionary activity.\tOne of the most important and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was a powerful orator, fluent in many languages, and wrote several major studies of socialist theory.\tShortly afterwards the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was organized, and from then until March 1923, Lenin dictated a series of articles which became his formal legacy to the Communist Party and the Russian people.\tThen, late in February 1917, the situation in Russia again altered dramatically, when a spontaneous uprising against the Tsar by crowds in Petrograd (formerly St. Petersburg) was joined by most of the Petrograd garrison and became the first (February, or bourgeois-democratic) Russian Revolution.\tThen, on 24 October, Lenin arrived at Smolny and took charge of the October Revolution, during which the provisional government was overthrown and Lenin declared the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and the formation of the Congress of Soviets.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.05wh0sh", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
