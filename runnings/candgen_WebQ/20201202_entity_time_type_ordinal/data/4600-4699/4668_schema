Whatever fortunes lavishly can pour, the mind annihilates and calls for more.\tControlled time is our true wealth.\tDon't knock the rich. When did a poor person give you a job?\tEvery man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one must have wealth.\tFor Wealth are all things that conduce, to one's destruction or their use. A standard both to buy and sell, all things from heaven down to hell.\tFortune gives too much to many, enough to none.\tGreat abundance of riches cannot be gathered and kept by any man without sin.\tHe does not posses wealth that allows it to possess him.\tHe that is proud of riches is a fool. For if he is exalted above his neighbors because he has more gold, how much inferior is he to a gold mine.\tHow much money is enough?\tI have about concluded that wealth is a state of mind, and that anyone can acquire a wealthy state of mind by thinking rich thoughts.\tIf prosperity is regarded as the reward of virtue it will be regarded as the symptom of virtue.\tIf we command our wealth, we shall be rich and free. If our wealth commands us, we are poor indeed.\tIf you see yourself as prosperous, you will be. If you see yourself as continually hard up, that is exactly what you will be.\tIll fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, where wealth accumulates, and men decay.\tIndustry, perseverance, and frugality make fortune yield.\tIt ain't so much trouble to get rich as it is to tell when we have got rich.\tIt is a wise man who lives with money in the bank, it is a fool who dies that way.\tIt is great wealth to a soul to live frugally with a contented mind.\tIt is only when the rich are sick that they fully feel the impotence of wealth.\tIt is sheer madness to live in want in order to be wealthy when you die.\tIt is, generally, in the season of prosperity that men discover their real temper, principles, and designs.\tLet none admire that riches grow in hell; that soil may best deserve the precious bane.\tNo one should be rich except those who understand it.\tOf the wealth of the world each has as much as they take.\tOrdinary riches can be stolen, real riches cannot. In your soul are infinitely precious things that cannot be taken from you.\tPlenty makes dainty!\tProbably the greatest harm done by vast wealth is the harm that we of moderate means do ourselves when we let the vices of envy and hatred enter deep into our own natures.\tRiches have never fascinated me, unless combined with the greatest charm or distinction.\tSome people lose their health getting wealth and then lose their wealth gaining health.\tSuperfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.\tSurplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community.\tThat some should be rich, shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just encouragement to industry and enterprise.\tThe conspicuously wealthy turn up urging the character building values of the privation of the poor.\tThe day is not far distant when the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth, which was free for him to administer during life, will pass away unwept, unhonored, and unsung, no matter to what uses he leave the dross which he cannot take with him. Of such as these the public verdict will then be: The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced. Such, in my opinion, is the true gospel concerning wealth, obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of the rich and the poor.\tThe first wealth is health.\tThe fortune which nobody sees makes a person happy and unenvied.\tThe gratification of wealth is not found in mere possession or in lavish expenditure, but in its wise application.\tThe main source of our wealth is goodness. The affections and the generous qualities that God admires in a world full of greed.\tThe odious and disgusting aristocracy of wealth is built upon the ruins of all that is good in chivalry or republicanism; and luxury is the forerunner of a barbarism scarcely capable of cure.\tThe only question with wealth is, what do you do with it?\tThe only thing wealth does for some people is to make them worry about losing it.\tThe petty economies of the rich are just as amazing as the silly extravagances of the poor.\tThe secret point of money and power in America is neither the things that money can buy nor power for power's sake... but absolute personal freedom, mobility, privacy. It is the instinct which drove America to the Pacific, all through the nineteenth century, the desire to be able to find a restaurant open in case you want a sandwich, to be a free agent, live by one's own rules.\tThe smell of profit is clean and sweet, whatever the source.\tThe way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.\tThe way to wealth depends on just two words, industry and frugality.\tThe wealth that cannot be administered is a burden.\tThere are many definite methods, honest and dishonest, which make people rich; the only instinct I know of which does it is that instinct which theological Christianity crudely describes as the sin of avarice.\tThere is a gigantic difference between earning a great deal of money and being rich.\tThere must be a reason why some people can afford to live well. They must have worked for it. I only feel angry when I see waste. When I see people throwing away things that we could use.\tThere's nothing so comfortable as a small bankroll. A big one is always in danger.\tThis country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.\tWe are stripped bare by the curse of plenty.\tWealth acquired by vanity shall be diminished; but he that gathers it by labor shall increase.\tWealth after all is a relative thing since he that has little and wants less is richer than he that has much and wants more.\tWealth is an inborn attitude of mind, like poverty. The pauper who has made his pile may flaunt his spoils, but cannot wear them plausibly.\tWealth is in applications of mind to nature; and the art of getting rich consists not in industry, much less in saving, but in a better order, in timeliness, in being at the right spot.\tWealth is not a matter of intelligence it's a matter of inspiration.\tWealth is not his that has it, but his that enjoys it.\tWealth is not without its advantages and the case to the contrary, although it has often been made, has never proved widely persuasive.\tWealth is so much the greatest good that Fortune has to bestow that in the Latin and English languages it has usurped her name.\tWealth is the ability to fully experience life.\tWealth is the product of man's capacity to think.\tWealth is well known to be a great comforter.\tWealth is what gives you the right to preach about the virtues of poverty.\tWealth maketh many friends. -- Proverbs 19:4\tWealth often takes away chances from men as well as poverty. There is none to tell the rich to go on striving, for a rich man makes the law that hallows and hollows his own life.\tWealth unused might as well not exist.\tWealth, in even the most improbable cases, manages to convey the aspect of intelligence.\tWhat a lot of things there are a man can do without.\tWhat difference does it make how much you have? What you do not have amounts to much more.\tWhat is the most important for democracy is not that great fortunes should not exist, but that great fortunes should not remain in the same hands. In that way there are rich men, but they do not form a class.\tWhat right have you to take the word wealth, which originally meant well-being, and degrade and narrow it by confining it to certain sorts of material objects measured by money.\tWhere there are friends there is wealth.\tWithout a rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar.\tYou can't take it with you when you go.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.01bc25", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
