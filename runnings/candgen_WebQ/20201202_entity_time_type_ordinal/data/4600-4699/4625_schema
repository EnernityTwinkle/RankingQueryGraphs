I have everything I want. I just want someone to be there for me, to make me feel safe and secure.\tIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms. The first is freedom of speech and expression--everywhere in the world. The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way--everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want--which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants--everywhere in the world. The fourth is freedom from fear--which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression gainst any neighbor--anywhere in the world.\tIt is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating.\tMan maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward.\tMany people think that by hoarding money they are gaining safety for themselves. if money is your ONLY hope for independence, you will never have it. The only real security that a person can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability. Without these qualities, money is practically useless.\tMost people never feel secure because they are always worried that they will lose their job, lose the money they already have, lose their spouse, lose their health, and so on. The only true security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way, that you are increasing the caliber of who you are and that you are valuable to your company, your friends, and your family.\tNo one has a prosperity so high and firm that two or three words can't dishearten it.\tNothing is secure but life, transition, the energizing spirit.\tOnly in growth, reform, and change, paradoxically enough, is true security to be found.\tOnly the insecure strive for security.\tSecurity is the chief enemy of mortals.\tSecurity is when everything is settled. When nothing can happen to you. Security is the denial of life.\tSecurity represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it.\tSecurity will produce danger.\tThe desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise.\tThe middle station is the most secure.\tThe more you seek security, the less of it you have. But the more you seek opportunity, the more likely it is that you will achieve the security that you desire.\tThe task we must set for ourselves is not to feel secure, but to be able to tolerate insecurity.\tThere can be no security where there is fear.\tThere is no such thing as security. There never has been.\tThere is nothing assured to mortals.\tThere is nothing stable in the world; uproar's your only music.\tThere's no security on this earth, only opportunity.\tWhatever has overstepped its due bounds is always in a state of instability.\tWithout a measureless and perpetual uncertainty, the drama of human life would be destroyed.\tYet one thing secures us what ever betide, the scriptures assures us the Lord will provide.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0bg2p", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
