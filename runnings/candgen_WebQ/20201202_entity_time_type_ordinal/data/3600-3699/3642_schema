thus proving the involvement of the brain in conditioned reflexes.\tHe found, for example, that a dog began producing saliva almost immediately after meat powder was put into its mouth.\tHe had perfected a technique by which he created a pouch in a dog's gullet which received the food taken by the dog through its mouth.\tHe had special sound-proof laboratories built where the dogs were isolated from each other and from all external stimuli save that introduced by the researcher in an outside room.\tHe is better known generally for his formulation of the laws of conditioned reflex.\tHe saw how much nervous excitation was involved in the circulation of the blood and in the digestive system and did everything he could to keep the dogs he used for his experiments in a healthy and stress-free condition.\tHe stated that unconditioned reflexes are innate, conditioned reflexes are acquired through experience.\tHe thus proved that the activity in the stomach was due to nervous stimulation rather than the belief that it was the action of the food on the stomach wall which stimulated production of juices.\tHe used salivation as a way of detecting the presence of psychical nervous activity and of measuring its intensity.\tHe was one of the first researchers to utilize antiseptic techniques in operations on animals and he also trained his dogs to accept the presence of a tube in the body as normal.\tHis findings were published in his \"\"Lectures on the Work of the Digestive Glands\"\" (1897).\tHis theory that the catatonic behavior seen in some mentally ill patients was an inhibitory protective reflex influenced  psychiatric treatment in Russia where such patients were treated in quiet and non-stimulating environments.\tHis work in this area led him to his formulation of the laws of conditioned reflex for which he is famous.\tIn 1875 he accepted a job as assistant to the professor of physiology at the Military Medical Academy but resigned in protest when the professor's appointment was revoked because he was Jewish.\tIn 1877 Pavlov won a scholarship for post-graduate study and research at the Academy.\tIn 1890 he became professor of pharmacology at the Military Medical Academy and a year later was appointed directory of the physiological department at the Institute of Experimental Medicine.\tIn 1904 Pavlov was awarded the Nobel prize for physiology and medicine for his demonstration that secretion of the digestive juices in the stomach and the pancreas is controlled by the nervous system and in particular by the vagus nerve.\tIn 1920 he met the British author H G Wells who was visiting Russia and who noted the difficulties encountered by academics.\tIn 1923 he was granted leave to leave the country to meet scientific colleagues.\tIn 1924 he resigned his chair of physiology in protest at discriminatory actions against the sons of priests, and in 1927 he wrote to Stalin criticizing the treatment of the Russian intelligentsia.\tIn America he met the physiologist Cannon with whom he kept in contact for the rest of his life.\tIn Breslau he studied the gastrointestinal system and in Leipzig he worked in the laboratory of the cardiovascular physiologist Ludwig.\tIn the West, his theories influenced the work of the psychologist Skinner.\tIn this way, the stimuli which triggered a reflex could be clearly differentiated.\tMeanwhile, any gastric secretions in the stomach could be drawn off for study, uncontaminated by ingested food.\tOn his return to Russia, Pavlov worked in Botkin's laboratory in St Petersburg investigating the cardiovascular and digestive systems.\tPavlov also investigated the inhibitory reflex, as seen when his dogs were disturbed by an unaccustomed noise or smell and immediately stopped salivating despite the continued presence of the stimuli which normally induced salivation.\tPavlov claimed that this was the origin of his interest in the digestive system.\tPavlov demonstrated that when a dog treated in this way was fed by mouth, it could eat for up to six hours (only stopping when its jaw muscles became exhausted), and its stomach - which had received none of the food - produced a pint and a half of digestive juices.\tPavlov had become interested in the subjective or psychical response of the dogs, as in the production of gastric juices at the mere sight of food.\tPavlov named the first type of reflex, caused by the presence of food in the mouth, an unconditioned reflex, and the second type a conditioned reflex.\tPavlov showed that the vagus nerve was the secretory nerve of the gastric glands.\tPavlov then went to run a laboratory which had been set up by the most famous Russian clinician of his time, Dr S P Botkin, the director of the medical clinic of the Academy.\tPavlov was an outspoken critic of the new regime and even requested permission to work overseas.\tPavlov's investigations of the digestive process formed the basis of modern medical and surgical treatment for gastrointestinal disorders.\tPavlov's work was interrupted by the Russian revolution and during the winter of 1917/18 many of his dogs died when food became scarce.\tThe action which produced the most juice appeared to be not the taste, chewing or swallowing of the food, but the sight of the food.\tThe dog could be kept in perfect health for years by being fed by a tube into its stomach.\tThe ingested food passed out of the pouch without reaching the dog's stomach.\tThe laboratory was actually a wooden shed in the garden and Pavlov had no official salary but he began to make his name in medical circles when it was realized that all the theses coming out of Botkin's clinic were based on Pavlov's work.\tThey also produced more saliva at the sight of dry food than at the sight of moist food, a fact which indicated the involvement of higher nervous activity than that related to digestion.\tThis was refused but Lenin issued a decree ensuring Pavlov's welfare in 1921.\tWhen he was a boy Pavlov  read Charles Darwin's \"\"Origin of the Species\"\" which remained an inspiration throughout his life.\tWhen the feeding routine was changed and an object was rotated in front of the dog before the food was put in its mouth, it took only about five instances of this new routine before the dog began salivating when the object was rotated and before the meat powder was put into its mouth.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.0dt1p", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
