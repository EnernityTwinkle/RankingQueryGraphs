the 'General Principles of Natural Philosophy' and the 'General Principles of Mathematical Science,' written during the 1270s and considered Bacon's most mature work.\tHe received his M.A. probably from the University of Paris c.1237, where during the next ten years he wrote his 'Brief Summaries of the Dialectic' and 'Synopsis of Grammar', and lectured at the Faculty of Arts.\tHis teachings covered the \"\"new\"\" Aristotelian works, including the 'Metaphysics', 'Physics' and 'Prior Analytics' (first studied in the West in the 12th century by Thierry of Chartres, the brother of Bernard of  Chartres^).\tHowever, many of his most interesting ideas and \"\"experiments\"\" seem only to have been suggested:  such as his suggestion for a balloon made from thin copper sheet filled with \"\"liquid fire\"\" which he believed would fly, his description of a flying machine with flapping wings, his explanation of the principles of reflection, refraction and spherical aberration and the resulting \"\"invention\"\" of spectacles (which soon came into use), his description of mechanically propelled ships and carriages, and his explanation of a camera obscura (which projects an image through a pinhole) to observe eclipses of the Sun.\tIn 1247 returned to Oxford, where he attempted to recover this secret knowledge through experimental research.\tIn 1257, Bacon chose to enter the Franciscan order, where he hoped to find support for his work and funds for his scientific instruments,  but the new Minister General,  Bonaventure particularly opposed studies in astrology and alchemy, and Bacon, who was increasingly vocal in his criticism of those with a more traditional approach to philosophy (which included the great scholars Albertus Magnus and Aquinas), had by the early 1260s become highly unpopular in the Order.\tIn response, in 1264 Bacon decided to appeal to Cardinal Guy le Gos de Foulques, to whom he communicated in a series of letters some of his revolutionary ideas concerning the natural world, mathematics, languages, perspective and astrology, arguing that a more accurate experimental knowledge of nature would be of great value to the church and the universities in confirming the Christian faith.\tIt was also during this period, in 1242, that Bacon became the first European to describe in detail a method of making gunpowder.\tIt was then followed in 1268 by supplements (including his 'On perspective', which not only gave an account of optics but also synthesized all previous knowledge on the subject in the works of, for example, Euclid, Ptolemy and Al Hazen).\tRoger Bacon was born c.1214 at Ilchester, in Somerset, England, into a wealthy family of the minor nobility, entering Oxford University c.1230, where he attended lectures on the \"\"new logic\"\" of Aristotle and developed a particular interest in natural philosophy and mathematics.\tThe following year, the cardinal became Pope Clement IV, and asked Bacon for a work which presented his views in detail.\tThe result, the ''Great Work', was an encyclopedia of the sciences and a proposal for a complete revision of educational reform which proposed including languages and the sciences in the curriculum of university studies.\tThese ideas contributed to Bacon's reputation in the popular imagination as a man of diverse and unconventional learning in philosophy, magic and alchemy (hence the soubriquet 'Doctor Mirabilis').\tThis work contained not only instruction on kingship but also occult knowledge, ranging from astrology and numerology to the magical medicinal properties of plants, and an account of a unified science which was claimed to have been transmitted to Aristotle by God through the Hebrews and Egyptians.\tWhile at Paris, Bacon became fascinated by 'Secret of Secrets', which was then thought to have been written by Aristotle for his pupil Alexander the Great.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.06g98", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
