Words are used to disguise, not to illuminate, action: you liberate a city by destroying it. Words are to confuse, so that at election time people will solemnly vote against their own interests\tCuriously enough, it seems to be only in describing a mode of language which does not mean what it says that one can actually say what one means.\tDrawing on my fine command of the language, I said nothing.\tEven if you do learn to speak correct English, whom are you going to speak it to?\tEverything can change, but not the language that we carry inside us, like a world more exclusive and final than one's mother's womb.\tFor me, myth is the \u2018common\u2019 language of us all.\tHow many languages are there in the world? How about 5 billion! Each of us talks, listens, and thinks in his/her own special language that has been shaped by our culture, experiences, profession, personality, mores and attitudes. The chances of us meeting someone else who talks the exact same language is pretty remote.\tI am always sorry when any language is lost, because languages are the pedigrees of nations.\tI like to be beholden to the great metropolitan English speech, the sea which receives tributaries from every region under heaven.\tIf everything is perfect, language is useless. This is true for animals. If animals don't speak, it's because everything's perfect for them. If one day they start to speak, it will be because the world has lost a certain sort of perfection.\tIf the Romans had been obliged to learn Latin they would never have found time to conquer the world.\tIf the announcer can produce the impression that he is a gentlemen, he may pronounce as he pleases.\tIf we spoke a different language, we would perceive a somewhat different world.\tIf you want to tell the untold stories, if you want to give voice to the voiceless, you've got to find a language. Which goes for film as well as prose, for documentary as well as autobiography. Use the wrong language, and you're dumb and blind.\tIt is a mass language only in the same sense that its baseball slang is born of baseball players. That is, it is a language which is being molded by writers to do delicate things and yet be within the grasp of superficially educated people. It is not a natural growth, much as its proletarian writers would like to think so. But compared with it at its best, English has reached the Alexandrian stage of formalism and decay.\tIt is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs.\tIt was Greek to me.\tLanguage can only deal meaningfully with a special, restricted segment of reality. The rest, and it is presumably the much larger part, is silence.\tLanguage is a city to the building of which every human being brought a stone.\tLanguage is a form of human reason, which has its internal logic of which man knows nothing.\tLanguage is a part of our organism and no less complicated than it.\tLanguage is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.\tLanguage is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.\tLanguage is a virus from outer space.\tLanguage is only the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas.\tLanguage is political. That's why you and me, my Brother and Sister, that's why we supposed to choke our natural self into the weird, lying, barbarous, unreal, white speech and writing habits that the schools lay down like holy law. Because, in other words, the powerful don't play; they mean to keep that power, and those who are the powerless (you and me) better shape up --mimic/ape/suck --in the very image of the powerful, or the powerful will destroy you --you and our children.\tLanguage is the archives of history.\tLanguage is the armory of the human mind, and at once contains the trophies of its past and the weapons of its future conquests.\tLanguage is the blood of the soul into which thoughts run and out of which they grow.\tLanguage is the dress of thought.\tLanguage is the mother of thought, not its handmaiden.\tLanguage is the pedigree of nations.\tLanguage most shows a man, speak that I may see thee.\tLanguage ought to be the joint creation of poets and manual workers.\tLanguage, the machine of the poet, is best fitted for his purpose in its rudest state. Nations, like individuals, first perceive, and then abstract. They advance from particular images to general terms. Hence the vocabulary of an enlightened society is philosophical, that of a half-civilized people is poetical.\tLife and language are alike sacred. Homicide and verbicide --that is, violent treatment of a word with fatal results to its legitimate meaning, which is its life --are alike forbidden.\tMale supremacy is fused into the language, so that every sentence both heralds and affirms it.\tMan invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain.\tMan, even man debased by the neocapitalism and pseudosocialism of our time, is a marvelous being because he sometimes speaks. Language is the mark, the sign, not of his fall but of his original innocence. Through the Word we may regain the lost kingdom and recover powers we possessed in the far-distant past.\tMethinks the human method of expression by sound of tongue is very elementary, and ought to be substituted for some ingenious invention which should be able to give vent to at least six coherent sentences at once.\tMight, could, would --they are contemptible auxiliaries.\tMy God! The English language is a form of communication! Conversation isn't just crossfire where you shoot and get shot at! Where you've got to duck for your life and aim to kill! Words aren't only bombs and bullets -- no, they're little gifts, containing meanings!\tNever resist a sentence you like, in which language takes its own pleasure and in which, after having abused it for so long, you are stupefied by its innocence.\tNo literature is complete until the language it was written in is dead.\tOne can say of language that it is potentially the only human home, the only dwelling place that cannot be hostile to man.\tOne does not inhabit a country; one inhabits a language. That is our country, our fatherland --and no other.\tPoetry is all nouns and verbs.\tPublic speaking is done in the public tongue, the national or tribal language; and the language of our tribe is the men's language. Of course women learn it. We're not dumb. If you can tell Margaret Thatcher from Ronald Reagan, or Indira Gandhi from General Somoza, by anything they say, tell me how. This is a man's world, so it talks a man's language.\tThe English have no respect for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it.\tThe common faults of American language are an ambition of effect, a want of simplicity, and a turgid abuse of terms.\tThe downtrodden, who are the great creators of slang.\tThe eyes have one language everywhere.\tThe finest language is mostly made up of simple unimposing words.\tThe genius of democracies is seen not only in the great number of new words introduced but even more in the new ideas they express.\tThe great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.\tThe language of truth is simple.\tThe learned fool writes his nonsense in better language than the unlearned, but it is still nonsense.\tThe living language is like a cowpath: it is the creation of the cows themselves, who, having created it, follow it or depart from it according to their whims or their needs. From daily use, the path undergoes change. A cow is under no obligation to stay\tThe secret of language is the secret of sympathy and its full charm is possible only to the gentle.\tThe significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it. To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world.\tThe word of man is the most durable of all material.\tThe words of language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The physical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images.\tThere is in every child a painstaking teacher, so skilful that he obtains identical results in all children in all parts of the world. The only language men ever speak perfectly is the one they learn in babyhood, when no one can teach them anything!\tThere is no such thing as an ugly language. Today I hear every language as if it were the only one, and when I hear of one that is dying, it overwhelms me as though it were the death of the earth.\tThere is no such thing as the Queen's English. The property has gone into the hands of a joint stock company and we own the bulk of the shares!\tThere is the fear, common to all English-only speakers, that the chief purpose of foreign languages is to make fun of us. Otherwise, you know, why not just come out and say it?\tThink like a wise man but communicate in the language of the people.\tThose who know nothing of foreign languages, knows nothing of their own.\tTo a teacher of languages there comes a time when the world is but a place of many words and man appears a mere talking animal not much more wonderful than a parrot.\tTo rescue from oblivion even a fragment of a language which men have used and which is in danger of being lost --that is to say, one of the elements, whether good or bad, which have shaped and complicated civilization --is to extend the scope of social observation and to serve civilization.\tTo write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no reliable words. Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up.\tViewed freely, the English language is the accretion and growth of every dialect, race, and range of time, and is both the free and compacted composition of all.\tWe are armed with language adequate to describe each leaf of the filed, but not to describe human character.\tWe don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.\tWe have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language.\tWe invent the world through language. The world occurs through language.\tWe might hypothetically possess ourselves of every technological resource on the North American continent, but as long as our language is inadequate, our vision remains formless, our thinking and feeling are still running in the old cycles, our process may be revolutionary but not transformative.\tWriting in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives.
