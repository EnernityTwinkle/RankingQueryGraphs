The school, whose benefactors included entrepreneurs such as Darby, was equipped by the Quakers and boasted an extensive library, which included the works Newton, and scientific equipment, which offered a stimulating atmosphere to the young Dalton.\tBelieving that this could be explained only by the behavior of atoms or \"\"particles of matter\"\", he concluded that the solubility of a gas depends on the weight of its atoms, and went on to study the variation of a gas volume with temperature.\tBerzelius was to replace Dalton's system with the chemical symbols still used today.\tDalton began by investigating the composition and behavior of gases.\tDalton's atomic theory was the most significant development in chemistry since the findings of the French chemist Lavoisier.\tDalton's work on gases led him to formulate his atomic theory.\tHaving established that air is a mixture, not a compound, Dalton proved that in a mixture of gases, each gas acts independently of the other.\tHe became convinced that the nature of mixed gases could be understood only by reference to atoms, and decided to use atomic weight as a practicable way of comparing individual atoms, theorizing that these weights should be evident from the relative weights of the elements that combine into well- known chemical compounds.\tHe concluded that gases must be made up of particles that occupy spaces between the particles that make up water, and that in a mixture of gases the different particles must intermingle rather than separate into layers, depending on their density, or weight.\tHe never appreciated the difference between atoms and molecules of elements.\tHe published the table in 1805 and later included it in his famous book, \"\"A New System of Chemical Philosophy\"\" (1808).\tHe was a family friend of William Henry.\tHe was the first to confirm that rain is caused by a fall in temperature, and he determined that the density of water varies with temperature.\tHis most successful pupil was the English physicist  Joule.\tHis study suggested that deficiency in color perception was caused by discoloration of the liquid medium of the eyeball.\tHis work related to that of  Leibniz, and Sturgeon.\tIn 1787, Dalton began a meteorological diary that he kept for 57 years.\tIn 1792, Dalton was appointed professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in \"\"New College\"\" in Manchester, established by the Presbyterians for free-church \"\"Dissenters\"\".\tIn 1793, he made the first systematic study of red-green color-blindness, outlining his results in an essay: \"\"Extraordinary Facts Relating to the Vision of Colours\"\", which he presented to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1794.\tIn 1800, Dalton resigned from New College to become secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and to work as a public and private teacher of mathematics and chemistry.\tIn 1803, Dalton gave a course of lectures at the Royal Institution in London, where he met  Davy, Wollaston, Cavendish and Banks.\tIn 1803, this finding led to the law of partial pressures, now known as Dalton's law, which states that in a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the pressures that each component would exert if it alone occupied the same volume.\tIn 1817, he became President of the Manchester Philosophical Society.\tIn 1822, he was elected to the Royal Society and to the French Academie des Sciences.\tIn 1833, thanks to the efforts of Babbage, and others, he was awarded a government pension.\tIn response to Dalton's work, Swedish chemist Berzelius began a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative weights of atoms.\tIt offered a first-class education to both laymen and candidates for the ministry (Cambridge and Oxford Universities were open only to members of the Church of England.) While in Manchester, Dalton began to study the phenomenon of color- blindness, which afflicted himself and his brother, Jonathan.\tLectures were also given by itinerant scientists.\tMost subjects dealt with aspects of meteorology -- the barometer, thermometer, hygrometer, rainfall, the formation of clouds, and the evaporation and the distribution and character of atmospheric moisture, including the concept of the dew point.\tOne Kendal resident who particularly influenced Dalton was the blind philosopher Gough, (who is mentioned in Wordsworth's poem \"\"The Excursion\"\".)   Recognizing Dalton's talent, Gough tutored him in mathematics, literature, languages, and botany and encouraged him to investigate meteorology.\tOne of the founders of atomic theory.\tOther 19th century chemists whose investigations resolved many of the methodological problems in Dalton's work included Gay-Lussac, ^work improved on by ^Avogadro^, Cannizzaro and Mendeleyev.\tThe hypothesis led him to express relative atomic weights of elements in multiples of the weight of one element -- hydrogen (the lightest known element) -- and then to calculate a table of relative weights.\tThe school opened shortly after Joseph Priestley's nearby Warrington Academy for Dissenters had  closed.\tTo Dalton, the atom was a material core of individual weight and size for individual elements, surrounded by an atmosphere of heat, which he regarded as material but weightless.\tWhen elected to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, he was sponsored by Percival and Robert Owen.\tWhen he traveled to Paris that year, he was introduced to Laplace, Berthollet, Gay-Lussac, Thenard, Arago, Biot, Alexander von Humboldt, Cuvier,  and AM Ampere.\tWithin five years, he had completed an outline of the work that would ensure his scientific reputation.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.0c0x7", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
