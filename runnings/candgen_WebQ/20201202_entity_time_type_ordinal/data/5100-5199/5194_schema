the east.\tAlthough a compromise candidate, Pierce was elected as the fourteenth President of the United States, winning by a generous margin over ex- General Winfield Scott.\tAnti-slavery sentiments became popular and a petition was presented for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\tBuchanan had been the front runner, but disagreement within the party eroded his vote.\tDuring the four years following the war, Pierce led a settled life in Concord, a successful lawyer and a political leader in the local Democratic party.\tHawthorne agreed, reluctantly, to write his biography and he sat for portraits and daguerreotypes, which were used in a publicity campaign all over the country.\tHe began practising in 1827, the year his father was made Governor of New Hampshire.\tHe instructed his ambassadors in Europe to begin to prepare they way for an American acquisition of Cuba, which was owned by Spain.\tHe opposed railroad interests, supported temperance in Concord and defended the American annexation of Texas to the extent that he became a Brigadier General during the Mexican War of 1846 to 1848.\tHe spent the first winter of his retirement in Madeira and then took a long tour, visiting all of the major countries of Europe.\tHe took over the country and set himself up as dictator, and later president, with the full support of Pierce, who ignored all principles of neutrality by recognising Walker's administration.\tHe went back to Concord and started to practice law again.\tIn 1835, slavery became an issue, fifteen years after The Missouri Compromise had declared the practise illegal north of latitude 36o 30'.\tIn 1842, he resigned from politics, as a result of pressure from his wife and because he wanted to earn a better living.\tIn 1850, he was elected as delegate for Concord to a convention set up to revise the State constitution.\tIn 1856, a constitutional crisis threatened over the resolution of the slavery question in Kansas and the power of popular sovereignty that had been given to the new territories in 1854.\tIn an attempt to divert attention away from the slavery issue, Pierce began a programme of territorial and commercial expansion.\tIn the political mess that followed, the US came close to war with Mexico again.\tIn the same year, he became a Democratic Congressman and was appointed to the Judiciary Committee.\tPerry sent word that they had succeeded, as well as agreeing limited access for US ships to Japanese ports.\tPierce became a Senator in 1837 but, although a loyal supporter of President Jackson, never achieved high office.\tPierce is regarded as a weak president who came to power as a compromise candidate during difficult times.\tPierce realised that he needed to raise his profile nationally if he was to become president.\tPierce saw the writing on the wall and decided not to stand for a second term as president, retiring from public life at the end of his first term, in 1857.\tPierce then appointed Townsend Harris, a New York merchant who was familiar with the East, as consul-general to Japan.\tPierce went to the same college as Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the newly created state of Maine, and when he left, he went home to Hillsborough to finish his law studies.\tPierce's policy over relations with Japan was more successful.\tPierce's politically inexperienced cabinet was mostly made up of southern planters and pragmatic northern businessmen, among them Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who was an army officer and planter.\tPierce's stance on the question strongly favoured placating the South.\tPresident James Polk made Pierce Federal District Attorney, after which he became prominent in local politics.\tRival railroad interests over a route to the Pacific provoked disputes in which the slavery issue became a factor.\tThe act of 1854 opened up two new territories, to try to stimulate migration to the northwest.\tThe first major act of the new government was to pass the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which legalised the principle of popular sovereignty in new territories, giving the settlers the right to pass their own laws on slavery, in direct opposition to the Missouri Compromise.\tThe following year, an American adventurer, William Walker, invaded Nicaragua, with a plan to set up an American puppet government that supported slavery.\tThe law had not been called into question in that time because no new states had been formed.\tThe plan failed in October 1854, when details of the Pierce's Ostend Manifesto, revealing US intentions, was leaked.\tThe previous president, Millard Fillmore, had sent a mission to Japan, led by Matthew C Perry, to negotiate trading agreements with the Japanese.\tThe resulting press coverage forced the Americans to disclaim any responsibility and Pierce recalled his ambassador to Spain.\tThe slavery issue was dominant in politics.\tTwo years later, he moved into politics as a member of the State Legislature in Concord, New Hampshire and in 1833, he campaigned for the Democratic presidential candidate, Andrew Jackson.\tTwo years later, the Democrats were having difficulty choosing a candidate for the presidency and, although New England was not a great force in Democratic politics, Pierce was nominated.\tWhen Civil War broke out, Pierce lost many friends when he condemned the action of the North.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.02z51", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
