when a bill was brought before Parliament for the suppression of atheism and a committee was appointed to look for evidence of Hobbes's views in the \"\"Leviathan\"\".\tEvents in England reached a climax with the execution of Charles I in 1649, and until 1653 when Cromwell was made Protector there was argument about the form of government which should be established.\tFor the followers of the new thinking of Galileo, motion was the norm and things only stopped moving when they were obstructed.\tFor those who followed Aristotle, things only moved when motion was induced by a mover, i.e. God.\tHe corresponded with Oldenburg.\tHe discussed the legitimate basis of government, the subject's right to resist, the status of the law and the position of the Church.\tHe planned a universal system of philosophy in three parts, dealing first with the physical science of motion in natural bodies, second with the internal movements in man that result in thoughts, sensations and feelings, and third with the organisation of the state so that its movements are beneficial to all.\tHe proposed an absolute sovereignty of government and rejected political democracy but set this within a form of social contract whereby each individual person contracts to obey the will of the supreme power, monarchical or otherwise.\tHe returned to England at the end of 1651 and settled in London.\tHe was on the point of retiring to a friend's house in Languedoc in southern France, when he accepted an invitation to act as mathematics tutor to the Prince of Wales, later Charles II, who had fled to Paris.\tHe was unfamiliar with the work done in his absence in mathematical studies, geometry and astronomy by men such as Wallis and Petty and laid himself open to critical attack from the group of Puritan intellectuals.\tHis philosophy was founded on pessimism about man's nature and a belief that submission to a single absolute power was the only effective counter to anarchy.\tHobbes also visited Galileo in Italy.\tHobbes disliked both Catholics who believed papal authority exceeded that of a country's secular government, and Puritans who believed their interpretations of God or the Bible took precedence over the sovereign,  so he provided justification for both a monarchy and a protectorate.\tHobbes offended the Royalists who accused him of atheism and not resisting Oliver Cromwell, and the Parliamentarians who distrusted his enthusiasm for absolute monarchy and his connections with Royalists.\tHobbes was one of the first modern writers on political theory and is seen as a forerunner of the Utilitarians.\tHowever, when he arrived back in England Hobbes was caught up in the religious and political unrest that preceded the Civil War and instead wrote a short treatise emphasising the correlation between absolute sovereignty and civil peace.\tIn 1610 he and Cavendish travelled in France and Italy and Hobbes was exposed to the new astronomical findings by Kepler and Galileo which challenged the orthodoxy of the Aristotelian universe and the beliefs of scholasticism.\tIn 1629, at a time when there was growing religious controversy and Parliament was rebelling against the autocratic rule of  Charles I,  Hobbes brought out his  translation of  \"\"Thucydides\"\".\tIn 1651 Hobbes joined the debate with the publication of his masterpiece, \"\"Leviathan, or the Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil\"\" which formed the third part of his planned trilogy concerning the state.\tIn 1675 he retired to the Devonshire estates at Chatsworth and at Hardwick in Derbyshire where he died.\tIn contrast to the position later taken by Locke, Hobbes stated that the supreme power was not subject to the contract.\tIn his  most frequently quoted phrase he expressed the view that under such conditions, the life of man is \"\" nasty, brutish and short\"\".\tLaw, said Hobbes, was not natural but the embodiment of the will of the sovereign power.\tNewton studied his work Was a friend of Selden.\tObedience to the sovereign was obligatory unless the sovereign could not impose his autocracy.\tOn his return Hobbes decided to become a classical scholar, had long conversations with Francis Bacon and helped to translate Bacon's essays into Latin, which strengthened Hobbes's growing dissatisfaction with the metaphysics and logic of Aristotelian thought.\tOver the next four years in Paris he worked on his theory of optics and his major philosophical work.\tThe Church should be subordinate to the state, and the sovereign power should have final say in the interpretation of divine law and the Scriptures.\tThe bill got through the Commons but was eventually dropped.\tThe duty of the sovereign authority was to provide conditions in which the security of the individual and the peace of the nation prevailed.\tThese new contacts exposed Hobbes to the new science of motion.\tThis new approach (and the influence of da Vinci) inspired Hobbes to construct a scientific scheme of knowledge in which he would apply Euclid's geometrical method  to the principles of the new science of motion.\tThucydides abhorred democracy and Hobbes published because he wanted to alert his fellow countrymen to the dangers of democracy.\tUnder the title \"\"Elements of Law\"\" the treatise was circulated in manuscript form before Hobbes fled to Paris in1640, fearing that he was in danger from the Parliamentarians.\tWhen he left Oxford in 1608 Hobbes became tutor to William Cavendish, (later the first Earl of Devonshire), a job which gave him opportunities for foreign travel, introductions to influential people and access to an excellent library.\tWhen the monarchy was restored in 1660, Hobbes was favored by Charles II who granted him a pension.\tWhen these conditions did not prevail, as in times of civil disorder, individuals had to make a moral choice about whether to obey the law of the land.", "answer_type":
