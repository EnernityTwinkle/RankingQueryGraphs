But for you...of course...whatever you require.\"\"\tA business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business.\tA client is to me a mere unit, a factor in a problem.\tA generation which has passed through the shop has absorbed standards and ambitions which are not of those of spaciousness, and cannot get away from them. Everything with them is done as though for sale, and they naturally have in view the greatest possible benefit, profit and that end of the stuff that will make the best show.\tA hard thing about business is minding your own\tA vacation should be just long enough that you're boss misses you, and not long enough for him to discover how well he can get along without you.\tAmong the worries of today's business executives is the large number of unemployed still on the payroll.\tBeing good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.\tBlessed is he who talks in circles, for he shall become a big wheel.\tBusiness conventions are important because they demonstrate how many people a company can operate without.\tBusiness has only two functions -- marketing and innovation.\tBusiness is a combination of war and sport.\tBusiness is like a wheelbarrow--it stands still until someone pushes it.\tBusiness is never so healthy as when, like a chicken, it must do a certain amount of scratching around for what it gets.\tBusiness is not just doing deals; business is having great products, doing great engineering, and providing tremendous service to customers. Finally, business is a cobweb of human relationships.\tCommerce is so far from being beneficial to arts, or to empire, that it is destructive of both, as all their history shows, for the above reason of individual merit being its great hatred. Empires flourish till they become commercial, and then they are scattered abroad to the four winds.\tCompromise is usually bad. It should be a last resort. If two departments or divisions have a problem they can't solve and it comes up to you, listen to both sides and then pick one or the other. This places solid accountability on the winner to make it work. Condition your people to avoid compromise.\tCorporation. An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility.\tCut your losses and let your profits run.\tDeals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.\tDon't forget until too late that the business of life is not business, but living.\tDon't open a shop unless you like to smile.\tDon't steal; thou it never thus compete successfully in business. Cheat.\tDon't try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. This can't be done, except by liars.\tDrive your business, let not you're business drive you.\tEvery man is a consumer and ought to be a producer.\tExecutives are like joggers. If you stop a jogger, he goes on running on the spot. If you drag an executive away from his business, he goes on running on the spot, pawing the ground, talking business. He never stops hurtling onwards, making decisions and executing them.\tFor the merchant, even honesty is a financial speculation.\tFormerly when great fortunes were only made in war, war was business; but now when great fortunes are only made by business: Business is war!\tHonor sinks where commerce long prevails.\tI buy when other people are selling.\tI do not believe a man can ever leave his business. He ought to think of it by day and dream of it by night.\tI think it is an immutable law in business that words are words, explanations are explanations, promises are promises -- but only performance is reality.\tIf a business does well, the stock eventually follows.\tIf a fellow wants to be a nobody in the business world, let him neglect sending the mail man to somebody on his behalf.\tIf each of us hires people smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs.\tIf we decide to take this level of business creating ability nationwide, we'll all be plucking chickens for a living.\tIf you can't pay for a thing, don't buy it. If you can't get paid for it, don't sell it. Do this, and you will have calm and drowsy nights, with all of the good business you have now and none of the bad. If you have time, don't wait for time.\tIf you don't do it with excellence, don't do it at all! Because if it's not excellent, it won't be profitable or fun, and if you're not in business for fun or profit, what the hell are you doing there?\tIf you don't drive your business you will be driven out of business.\tIn business partnerships and marriage partnerships, oh, the cheating that goes on.\tIn business, words are words; explanations are explanations, promises are promises, but only performance is reality.\tIndustry is the soul of business and the keystone of prosperity.\tIt doesn't matter to me if a man is from Harvard or Sing Sing. We hire the man, not his history.\tIt is much more difficult to measure non-performance than performance. Performance stands out like a ton of diamonds. Non-performance can almost always be explained away.\tIt is not the employer who pays wages -- he only handles the money. It is the product who pays the wages.\tIt is the interest of the commercial world that wealth should be found everywhere.\tIt is very vulgar to talk about one's business. Only people like stockbrokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\tIt's better to take over and build upon an existing business than to start a new one.\tIt's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\tLeisure for people of business, and business for people of leisure would cure many problems.\tLet love give way to business; give attention to business and you will be safe.\tMake every decision as if you owned the whole company.\tMethod goes far to prevent trouble in business: for it makes the task easy, hinders confusion, saves abundance of time, and instructs those that have business depending, both what to do and what to hope.\tMost men are individuals no longer so far as their business, its activities, or its moralities are concerned. They are not units but fractions.\tNever hire someone who knows less than you do about what he's hired to do.\tNever write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your own family to read. You wouldn't tell lies to your own wife. Don't tell them to mine. Do as you would be done by. If you tell lies about a product, you will be found out -- either by the Government, which will prosecute you, or by the consumer, who will punish you by not buying your product a second time. Good products can be sold by honest advertising. If you don't think the product is good, you have no business to be advertising it.\tNo man tastes pleasures truly, who does not earn them by previous business; and few people do business well, who do nothing else.\tNobody ever lost money taking a profit.\tPeople want economy and they'll pay almost any price to get it.\tPeople will go right on preferring to do business with friends.\tPerpetual devotion to what a man calls his business, is only to be sustained by perpetual neglect of many other things.\tSo much for industry, my friends, and attention to one's own business; but to these we must add frugality if we would make our industry more certainly successful. A man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep his nose all his life to the grindstone, and die not worth a grout at last.\tSome people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look on it as a cow they can milk. Not enough people see it as a healthy horse, pulling a sturdy wagon.\tSuch is the brutalization of commercial ethics in this country that no one can feel anything more delicate than the velvet touch of a soft buck.\tThe best minds are not in government. If any were, business would hire them away.\tThe business of the country is business.\tThe consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife.\tThe first thing the secretary types is the boss.\tThe happiest time in a man's life is when he is in the red hot pursuit of a dollar with a reasonable prospect of overtaking it.\tThe magic formula that successful businesses have discovered is to treat customers like guests and employees like people.\tThe most important word in the vocabulary of advertising is TEST. If you pretest your product with consumers, and pretest your advertising, you will do well in the marketplace.\tThe most sensible people to be met with in society are men of business and of the world, who argue from what they see and know, instead of spinning cobweb distinctions of what things ought to be.\tThe novice in advertising frequently gives the public credit, for too much intelligence.\tThe poor man who enters into a partnership with one who is rich makes a risky venture.\tThe propensity to truck, barter and exchange one thing for another is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals.\tThe purpose of a business is to create a customer.\tThe right merchant is one who has the just average of faculties we call common sense; a man of a strong affinity for facts, who makes up his decision on what he has seen. He is thoroughly persuaded of the truths of arithmetic. There is always a reason, in the man, for his good or bad fortune in making money. Men talk as if there were some magic about this. He knows that all goes on the old road, pound for pound, cent for cent -- for every effect a perfect cause -- and that good luck is another name for tenacity of purpose.\tThe selfish spirit of commerce, which knows no country, and feels no passion or principle but that of gain.\tThe simple opposition between the people and big business has disappeared because the people themselves have become so deeply involved in big business.\tThe worst disease which can afflict executives in their work is not, as popularly supposed, alcoholism; it's egotism.\tThere is nothing more requisite in business than dispatch.\tTo business that we love we rise betime, and go to't with delight.\tTreat employees like partners, and they act like partners.\tUnequal combinations are always disadvantageous to the weaker side.\tUtility is our national shibboleth: the savior of the American businessman is fact and his uterine half-brother, statistics.\tWell, I don't know as I want a lawyer to tell me what I cannot do. I hire him to tell how to do what I want to do.\tWhen the product is right, you don't have to be a great marketer.\tWhen two friends have a common bank account, one sings and the other weeps.\tWork is our business; it's success is God s.\tYou can close more business in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.\tYou can't run a business or anything else on a theory.\tYou don't hear things that are bad about your company unless you ask. It is easy to hear good tidings, but you have to scratch to get the bad news.\tYou have to have your heart in the business and the business in your heart.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.09s1f", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}

Edgar Thomson (the president of  the Pennsylvania Railroad) financed a sleeping-car company, established by Theodore Woodruff.\tHe combined a blend of traditional ownership with modern management techniques which relied on accurate business calculations and strict economy.\tHe had earlier, in 1881, given a library and swimming pool to the town of Dunfermline, Scotland.\tHe had instructed Frick not to renew contracts unless the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers disbanded.\tHe obliged his partners to be active managers and profit was ploughed back into the company.\tHe used Bessemer's steel-making process He hired Fessenden.\tHe was promoted to part-time telegrapher, and, at 16, became a full-time operator.\tHe worked with CM Schwab, whom he sent to visit Krupp.\tHis grandmother was Rennie's sister He knew Gary and Mellon.\tHis work related to that of Eads and Bessemer.\tIn 1848, on borrowed money, the family set sail for the United States.\tIn 1872, at 37, Carnegie struck it even more rich.\tIn Pittsburgh, the 13-year-old Carnegie was taken on by another Scot, John Jay, as a bobbin boy in a cotton mill, with occasional stints in the office, where he learned the rudiments of bookkeeping and management and took a business course at night.\tIn the 1890s, after the American steel market became flooded by overproduction, Carnegie opposed the pooling of assets and refused association with any of the holding companies that sought to stabilize prices.\tScott hired Carnegie as his personal telegrapher and secretary in 1852, when Carnegie was 17.\tTension grew and a fight called the Battle of the Monongahela River broke out in the summer.\tThe deal was almost risk-free since Thomson would make sure Woodruff's company got Pennsylvania RR business.\tThe industrial revolution sweeping Scotland destroyed Carnegie's father's livelihood as weaver.\tThe rest he would invest in good causes.\tThe shares they were given, though fractional, were worth huge amounts of money.\tThe two struck a deal.\tThese were vast sums at the time.\tThey did not, so their jobs were given to others.\tThis policy brought Frick, an owner of coalfields and a coke producer, into the company in 1881.\tThrough the years, Carnegie gave out partnerships to his best employees.\tTo invest in a new steel mill to produce railroad sleepers, he liquidated his assets.\tTwice, in 1897 and 1899, financier J. P.
