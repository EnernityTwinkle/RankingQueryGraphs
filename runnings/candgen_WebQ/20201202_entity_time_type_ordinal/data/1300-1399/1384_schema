clergy or the nobility,  the Third Estate soon began to demand that voting should on an individual basis, not by chamber.\tBy 1789, the country was bankrupt,  so, for the first time since 1614 Louis called together the States-General, an assembly made up of three chambers: the Clergy, the Nobility and the Commons (known as the Third Estate).\tBy now, extremists were in control of the National Assembly and they forced Louis to replace it with a radical Convention.\tCondorcet wrote justification of his removal.\tDespite this, his popularity with the court sank when he revealed his 'Compte Rendu', (Account Rendered), in which he published the country's public finance accounts.\tEnnobled PS Du Pont.\tEventually, when he tried to reform the royal corvee (the organization of forced labor on roads and bridges) opposition was so strong that he was forced to resign.\tFrance was already an ally of the American colonial rebels in their War of Independence against the British.\tHe also

Hungary.\tIn January of 1793, Louis was tried for treason and condemned to death.\tIt was rumoured that Louis planned a counter-revolution, but the Paris rebels arrived in Versailles 5th October 1789 and took him and his family back to Paris,  where they were detained in the Palace of Tuilleries and closely observed until Louis swore to uphold the new constitution, on 14th July 1790.\tJefferson

away civil liberties, revoking the Edict of Nantes (which had given the Huguenot Protestants religious freedom) and draining the economy with his wars.\tLouis XV had been extravagant and self- indulgent and had brought the country to the brink of financial disaster.\tLouis was faced with demands for reform and he had no idea how to cope.\tLouis' actions triggered the storming of the Bastille prison on 14th July 1789.\tLouis' indecision brought the downfall of the monarchy and the French Revolution, but at the beginning of his reign, his support of the Americans assured their victory in the War of Independence.\tMany people, including Gouverneur Morris, the American minister in Paris, suggested to Louis that the time had come to run for it, but he would not listen,  mistakenly believing that his people still wanted him.\tNecker favored financial reform,  and imposed spending restrictions which enabled him to fund the Americans without raising taxes.\tOn 20th June 1789, this new body was established and named the National Assembly.\tOn 20th June 1791, Louis and his family attempted to flee, but were captured at Varennes.\tOn 27th April 1774, his father died of smallpox, Louis became King and the illiterate Maria-Antonia became Queen Marie-Antoinette.\tOn the morning of 21st January 1793, both he and Marie Antoinette were beheaded.\tOne of his first actions was to restore the powers of the Parlement,  and he appointed the reformer, Turgot as first minister.\tPaine spoke against his execution.\tRameau wrote music for his birth David voted for his

'Declaration of the Rights of Man'.\tThe Third Estate held their own meeting in the covered tennis court in Versailles,  where they passed The Tennis Court Oath, agreeing not to disperse until a new constitutional body had been formed.\tThe function of the assembly was to advise the King, each chamber having a vote.\tThe power of the monarchy was declining, government was crippled by debt, trade had deteriorated and the financial, religious and aristocratic classes were exempt from taxation.\tThe trap was sprung when the first act of the new Convention, on 21st September 1791, was to abolish the monarchy.\tThey were returned to Paris, where Louis was made a constitutional monarch, with all power now in the hands of the common people.\tTurgot had plans to impose a strict economy on the government and the royal households,  rework the entire system of taxation, abolish the monopoly of the guilds and remove internal barriers to the circulation of grain.\tUnfortunately, in publishing it, he revealed to taxpayers how much money taxes took from them.\tUnsurprisingly, Turgot faced serious opposition from a royal household determined not to surrender its perks.\tWith Turgot out of the
