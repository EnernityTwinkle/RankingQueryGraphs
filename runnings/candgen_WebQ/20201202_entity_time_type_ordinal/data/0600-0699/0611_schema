I repeat, that I have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of my station will permit, or the public good shall require to be disclosed: and in fact, all the Papers affecting the negotiation with Great Britain were laid before the Senate, when the Treaty itself was communicated for their consideration and advice.

was ambushed by the French and their Indian allies on the Monongahela River.\tAfter holding his bedraggled and dispirited army together during the difficult winter (1777-78) at Valley Forge, Washington learned that France had recognized American independence.\tAfter several hours of fierce fighting, on 3 July Washington was forced to surrender when driving rain flooded the fort and ruined his ammunition.\tAfter the war, Washington returned to Mount Vernon, which had declined in his absence.\tAlthough Washington reluctantly accepted command of the army in 1798 when war with France seemed imminent, he did not assume an active role, preferring to spend his last years in retirement at Mount Vernon.\tAlthough he received public recognition and many awards and honors - including, in 1781, along with the English philosopher and supporter of the American Revolution Price, an honorary degree from Yale - he at first avoided involvement in Virginia politics.\tAlthough he was a good administrator, he failed to heal the breach between factions led by Jefferson (Democratic-Republicans) and Hamilton (Federalists), and because he supported many of Hamilton's controversial fiscal policies - including the assumption of state debts, the Bank of the United States, and the excise tax  -  during the early 1790s Washington became the target of vicious personal attacks by Jefferson's supporters.\tAlthough the campaigns here were conducted by other generals, Washington remained responsible for the overall direction of the war.\tAndrew Jackson voted against tributes on his retirement.\tAs a result, in 1755, at the age of 23, he was promoted to colonel and appointed commander-in-chief of the Virginia militia, with responsibility for defending the frontier.\tAs full-scale war between Britain and France became inevitable, Washington was eager to participate, but when he learned that the British government had ordered that colonials could hold a rank no higher than captain, he resigned his commission at the end of 1754.\tBy 1753 the growing rivalry between the British and French over control of the Ohio Valley, soon to erupt into the French and Indian War (1754-63), created new opportunities for the ambitious young Washington, and in October 1753 he was dispatched by Dinwiddie on a fruitless mission to warn the French commander at Fort Le Boeuf against further encroachment on territory claimed by Britain.\tBy March 1797, when Washington left office, the country's financial system was well established, the American Indian threat east of the Mississippi had been largely eliminated, and both Jay's and Pinckney's Treaty (1795) with Spain had enlarged U.S. territory and removed serious diplomatic difficulties.\tCommander-in-chief of American forces during the American Revolution, chairman of the Convention that wrote the United States Constitution, and first President of the United States, he led the movement which turned America from an English colony into a self-governing nation.\tDuring his first term of office, Washington generally acted carefully and deliberately as President (as he had as military commander), aware of the need to build an firm foundation and executive structure that could accommodate future governments and presidents.\tDuring this month-long expedition, Washington began to appreciate the uses and value of land, and on his return studied surveying and became licensed by the College of William and Mary.\tEarly in March 1776, using cannon brought down from Ticonderoga by Henry Knox, Washington occupied Dorchester Heights, effectively commanding the city and forcing the British to evacuate.\tEndowed Washington College.\tFighting broke out in spring 1775, and in June Washington was unanimously appointed as commander-in-chief of the rebel forces besieging British-occupied Boston.\tFriend of politician Gouverneur Morris.\tGeorge Washington was born in 1732 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, the eldest son of Augustine Washington and his second wife, Mary Ball, who were prosperous Virginia gentry of English descent.\tHe ordered Paine's pamphlet to be read to the troops at Valley Forge.\tHe then moved to defend New York City against the combined land and sea forces of Sir William Howe, but eventually retreated from Manhattan through New Jersey into Pennsylvania.\tHe took the oath administered by Livingston on 30th April 1789 in New York City, at the age of 57.\tHe was succeeded by his vice-president, Federalist John Quincy Adams.\tHis acceptance of Jay's Treaty (1795), which settled outstanding differences between the United States and Britain (but which Democratic- Republicans viewed as a surrender to British demands), revived attacks on the President.\tHis early education included the study of mathematics, the classics, and \"\"rules of civility.\"\" When his father died in 1743, Washington became a ward of his half-brother Lawrence, and went to Mount Vernon to live on his plantation on the Potomac.\tHis ideals of liberty and democracy set a standard for future presidents and for the whole country.\tHis presence together with Franklin lent prestige to the proceedings, and although he made few direct contributions he generally supported the move for a strong constitutional government.\tIn 1748 Washington was taken on a surveying expedition by George William Fairfax in the Shenandoah Valley wilderness.\tIn 1749 he was appointed Culpeper County surveyor, and helped lay out the Virginia town of Belhaven (now Alexandria).\tIn 1751, Washington accompanied Lawrence to Barbados in an effort to cure his tuberculosis.\tIn 1774-75, Washington acted as a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congress where he joined ranks with such revolutionaries as Samuel Adams.\tIn 1780 the main theater of the war shifted to the South, where Britain held Georgia and much of the Carolinas.\tIn 1789, after the new Constitution was submitted to the states for ratification, he was unanimously elected President and agreed to serve.\tIn January 1759, he married Martha Dandridge Custis, a wealthy young widow with two small children and the same year, with the support of an ever-growing circle of influential friends, he entered politics, serving (1759-74) in Virginia's House of Burgesses (the colonial assembly), and also as a county justice and vestryman in his parish.\tIn June 1778 he attacked the British near Monmouth Courthouse, N.J., as they were withdrawing from Philadelphia to New York, and Washington's quick action on the field prevented an American defeat.\tIn May 1787, however, Washington headed the Virginia delegation to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was unanimously elected presiding officer.\tIn mid- December 1799, Washington contracted what was probably quinsy or acute laryngitis, and died after a brief illness.\tIn spite of the animosities and conflicting opinions between Democratic- Republicans (which included future fifth president Monroe) and members of the Hamiltonian Federalist party, the two groups were at least united in accepting the new Federal government.\tLawrence failed to recover and died on his return home in 1752.\tMeanwhile, the major success of that year, the defeat in October 1777 of the British at Saratoga, had belonged not to Washington but to Benedict Arnold and General Horatio Gates.\tMeanwhile, with Lawrence's death Virginia's colonial governor Robert Dinwiddie appointed Washington adjutant commander of one of Virginia's four militia districts with the rank of major.\tNoah Webster was a supporter.\tOn 28 May 1754 he met a small French and Indian party, and in the resulting skirmish the French commander, Joseph Coulon, sieur de Jumonville, was killed and most of his men captured.\tOn his arrival Washington learned that the French, numbering more than a thousand, had captured the fort (which they named Fort Duquesne).\tOn taking office, Washington was immediately faced with filling almost a thousand offices, the most important going to Jay (chief justice), Jefferson (Secretary of State), Alexander Hamilton (Secretary of the Treasury), Henry Knox (Secretary of War), Edmund Randolph (attorney general), and Samuel Osgood (postmaster general).\tRobert E. Lee married his adopted son's daughter.\tSoon afterwards Washington leased the Mount Vernon estate from Lawrence's widow, and by 1761 had acquired the property outright.\tThe French agreed to lenient terms, allowing Washington to march his remaining troops back to Williamsburg.\tThe French party had in fact been charged with issuing a peaceful warning, and the French were outraged, calling the killing an \"\"assassination\"\", and sending a party of 1200 to attack Fort Necessity.\tThe contrast between Washington's record and Gates's brilliant victory was one factor that led to the so-called \"\"Conway Cabal\"\" - an intrigue by some members of Congress and army officers to replace Washington with a more successful commander, probably Gates.\tThe following year, however, he joined British general Edward Braddock's expedition against the French as a volunteer.\tWashington acted quickly, and the plan eventually collapsed due to the lack of public support and Washington's overall superiority to his rivals.\tWashington built a small fort he named Fort Necessity, about forty miles away at Great Meadows, Pennsylvania, and marched to intercept any French troops.\tWashington left the army in 1758 and returned to Mount Vernon.\tWashington refused to run for a third term and, after a masterly Farewell Address in which he warned the United States against \"\"the baneful effects\"\" of party politics and against permanent alliances abroad, he went home to Mount Vernon.\tWashington spent his early years on the family estate on Pope's Creek along the Potomac River, and attended school irregularly from the ages of seven to fourteen, first with the local church sexton and later with a local schoolmaster.\tWashington was re-elected president in 1792, and the following year a major crisis occurred in his cabinet over the issue of American neutrality during the war between England and France.\tWashington's diary account of the dangers and difficulties of his journey was published at the colonial capital of Williamsburg on his return in early 1754, and helped to win him promotion to lieutenant colonel.\tWashington's fearless conduct in battle, and his dramatic descriptions of these engagements - written to a younger brother, but subsequently published all over America - made him a hero of English-speaking America.\tWashington, although seriously ill, managed to lead the survivors to safety, again enhancing his military reputation.\tWashington, whose policy of neutrality angered the pro-French Jeffersonians, was horrified by the excesses of the French Revolution and enraged by the tactics of Edmond Genet, the French minister in the United States, which amounted to foreign interference in American politics.\tWith an eye to developing closer commercial ties with the British, the president agreed with the Hamiltonians on the need for peace with Great Britain.\tWith the aid of the Prussian Baron von Steuben and the Frenchman LaFayette, he concentrated on turning the army into a fighting force, and by spring 1778 he was ready to take the field again.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.034rd", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
