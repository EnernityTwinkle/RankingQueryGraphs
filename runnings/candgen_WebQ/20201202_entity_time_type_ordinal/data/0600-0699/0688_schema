A man can no more possess a private religion than he can possess a private sun and moon.\tA good test of a man's religion is its vitality.\tA knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms\u2014it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.\tA maker of idols is never an idolater.\tA man has no religion who has not slowly and painfully gathered one together, adding to it, shaping it; and one's religion is never complete and final, it seems, but must always be undergoing modification.\tA religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.\tA religion, that is, a true religion, must consist of ideas and facts both; not of ideas alone without facts, for then it would be mere Philosophy; -- nor of facts alone without ideas, of which those facts are symbols, or out of which they arise, or upon which they are grounded: for then it would be mere History.\tA wise architect observed that you could break the laws of architectural art provided you had mastered them first. That would apply to religion as well as to art. Ignorance of the past does not guarantee freedom from its imperfections.\tAfter coming into contact with a religious man I always feel I must wash my hands.\tAll gods are tricksters, and war gods worst of any.\tAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\tAll religions have based morality on obedience, that is to say, on voluntary slavery. That is why they have always been more pernicious than any political organization. For the latter makes use of violence, the former -- of the corruption of the will.\tAll the sweetness of religion is conveyed to the world by the hands of story-tellers and image-makers. Without their fictions the truths of religion would for the multitude be neither intelligible nor even apprehensible; and the prophets would prophesy and the teachers teach in vain.\tAnd lips say God be pitiful, who never said, God be praised.\tBandara was not an easy place to return to:  it could hide from the common worlds whose periphery it inhabited.  But Bandara never had, in all its years, completely disappeared.\tBut is it not the fact that religion emanates from the nature, from the moral state of the individual? Is it not therefore true that unless the nature be completely exercised, the moral state harmonized, the religion cannot be healthy?\tCulture's essential service to a religion is to destroy intellectual idolatry, the recurrent tendency in religion to replace the object of its worship with its present understanding and forms of approach to that object.\tDemocracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values.\tDon't try to tear down other people's religion about their ears, Build up your own perfect structure of truth, and invite your listeners to enter in and enjoy it's glories.\tEvery man heals himself.\tEvery religion is good that teaches man to be good; and I know of none that instructs him to be bad.\tFor a truly religious man nothing is tragic.\tFor it is with the mysteries of our religion, as with wholesome pills for the sick, which swallowed whole, have the virtue to cure; but chewed, are for the most part cast up again without effect.\tGive us a religion that will help us to live -- we can die without assistance.\tI am always most religious upon a sunshiny day...\tI cannot see how a man of any large degree of humorous perception can ever be religious -- except he purposely shut the eyes of his mind and keep them shut by force.\tI count religion but a childish toy, and hold there is no sin but innocence.\tI do benefits for all religions -- I'd hate to blow the hereafter on a technicality.\tI don't want to be any closer to the gods than death will bring me.\tI think that the leaf of a tree, the meanest insect on which we trample, are in themselves arguments more conclusive than any which can be adduced that some vast intellect animates Infinity.\tI'm reverent from a distance.\tIsn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?\tIt is a good and gentle religion, but inconvenient.\tIt is certain that if you would have the whole secret of a people, you must enter into the intimacy of their religion.\tIt is upon each soul to recognize its limit.\tIt's incongruous that the older we get, the more likely we are to turn in the direction of religion. Less vivid and intense ourselves, closer to the grave, we begin to conceive of ourselves as immortal.\tMan is made to adore and to obey: but if you will not command him, if you give him nothing to worship, he will fashion his own divinities, and find a chieftain in his own passions.\tMen despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true.\tMy religion consists of a humble admiration of the unlimitable superior who reveals Himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.\tMy religion? Well, my dear, I am a Millionaire. That is my religion.\tNo, if you talk to God you're religious. If God talks to you, you're psychotic.\tNobody can deny but religion is a comfort to the distressed, a cordial to the sick, and sometimes a restraint on the wicked; therefore whoever would argue or laugh it out of the world without giving some equivalent for it ought to be treated as a common enemy.\tNot every religion has to have St. Augustine's attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesn't prevent it being a religious ceremony.\tNothing is so fatal to religion as indifference which is, at least, half infidelity.\tOf all possible sexual perversions, religion is the only one to have ever been scientifically systematized.\tOh senseless man, who cannot possibly make a worm, and yet will make Gods by dozens.\tOpium of the people\tOur knowledge of the historical worth of certain religious doctrines increases our respect for them, but does not invalidate our proposal that they should cease to be put forward as the reasons for the precepts of civilization. On the contrary! Those historical residues have helped us to view religious teachings, as it were, as neurotic relics, and we may now argue that the time has probably come, as it does in an analytic treatment, for replacing the effects of repression by the results of the rational operation of the intellect.\tReligion I have disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give to them, and that is the Christian religion. If they had that and I had not given them one cent, they would be rich. If they have not that, and I had given them the world, they would be poor.\tReligion enables us to ignore nothingness and get on with the jobs of life.\tReligion is a temper, not a pursuit.\tReligion is doing; a man does not merely think his religion or feel it, he lives his religion as much as he is able, otherwise it is not religion but fantasy or philosophy.\tReligion is like holding on to a rock in the middle of a raging river; faith is learning how to swim.\tReligion is probably, after sex, the second oldest resource which human beings have available to them for blowing their minds.\tReligion is the opium of the masses.\tReligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\tReligion! what treasure untold resides in that heavenly word!\tReligion, oh, just another of those numerous failures resulting from an attempt to popularize art.\tReligion. A daughter of Hope and Fear, explaining to Ignorance the nature of the Unknowable.\tReligions are the cradles of despotism.\tReligions die when they are proved to be true. Science is the record of dead religions.\tReligions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic.\tScience is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.\tSo well do I love you, I go to my god singing your praises.  When I meet my father, I will tell him I fought beside you.\tTalk to me about the truth of religion and I'll listen gladly. Talk to me about the duty of religion and I'll listen submissively. But don't come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don't understand.\tThe idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas -- uncertainty, progress, change -- into crimes.\tThe main business of religions is to purify, control, and restrain that excessive and exclusive taste for well-being which men acquire in times of equality.\tThe religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide.\tThe true meaning of religion is thus, not simply morality, but morality touched by emotion.\tThere is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.\tThere must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we denominate religious. If glad, it must not grin or snicker; if sad, it must not scream or curse.\tThere's no reason to bring religion into it. I think we ought to have as great a regard for religion as we can, so as to keep it out of as many things as possible.\tTo become a popular religion, it is only necessary for a superstition to enslave a philosophy.\tTo know a person's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance.\tToleration is the best religion.\tWe are on the side of religion as opposed to religions, and we are among those who believe in the wretched inadequacy of sermons and the sublimity of prayer.\tWhen a culture feels that its end has come, it sends for a priest.\tWherever an altar is found, there civilization exists.\tYou never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat's meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly.
