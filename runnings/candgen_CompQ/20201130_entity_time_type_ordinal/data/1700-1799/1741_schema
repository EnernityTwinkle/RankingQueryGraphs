If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.\tA school without football is in danger of deteriorating into a medieval study hall.\tAfter the cheers have died down and the stadium is empty, after the headlines have been written and after you are back in the quiet of your room and the championship ring has been placed on the dresser and all the pomp and fanfare has faded, the enduring things that are left are: the dedication to excellence, the dedication to victory, and the dedication to doing with our lives the very best we can to make the world a better place in which to live.\tAll right Mister, let me tell you what winning means... you're willing to go longer, work harder, give more than anyone else.\tBuild for your team a feeling of oneness, of dependence on one another and of strength to be derived by unity.\tCoaches who can outline plays on a black board are a dime a dozen. The ones who win get inside their player and motivate.\tDictionary is the only place that success comes before work. Hard work is the price we must pay for success. I think you can accomplish anything if you're willing to pay the price.\tEvery time a football player goes to ply his trade he's got to play from the ground up -- from the soles of his feet right up to his head. Every inch of him has to play. Some guys play with their heads. That's OK You've got to be smart to be number one in any business. But more importantly, you've got to play with your heart, with every fiber of your body. If you're lucky enough to find a guy with a lot of head and a lot of heart, he's never going to come off the field second.\tFatigue makes cowards of us all.\tFootball is like life -- it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority.\tI firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle -- victorious.\tI've never known a man worth his salt who in the long run, deep down in his heart, didn't appreciate the grind, the discipline... I firmly believe that any man's finest hour-this greatest fulfillment to all he holds dear--is the moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle -- victorious.\tIf you aren't fired up with enthusiasm, you'll be fired with enthusiasm.\tIf you can accept losing you can't win. If you can walk you can run. No one is ever hurt. Hurt is in your mind.\tIf you'll not settle for anything less than your best, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish in your lives.\tInches make champions.\tIndividual commitment to a group effort -- that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\tIt is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever -- the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.\tIt's easy to have faith in yourself and have discipline when you're a winner, when you're number one. What you've got to have is faith and discipline when you're not yet a winner.\tIt's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.\tLeaders are made, they are not born. They are made by hard effort, which is the price which all of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.\tLeaders aren't born, they are made. And they are made just like anything else, through hard work. And that's the price we'll have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal.\tMental toughness is many things. It is humility because it behooves all of us to remember that simplicity is the sign of greatness and meekness is the sign of true strength. Mental toughness is spartanism with qualities of sacrifice, self-denial, dedication. It is fearlessness, and it is love.\tOnce you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent's pressure, and the temporary failures.\tOnce you learn to quit, it becomes a habit.\tPeople who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses, or the problems of modern society.\tPractice does not make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.\tPractice doesn\u2019t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.\tRun for daylight.\tSome of us will do our jobs well and some will not, but we will all be judged by only one thing -- the result.\tSome people try to find things in this game that don't exist but football is only two things-blocking and tackling.\tTeamwork is what the Green Bay Packers were all about. They didn't do it for individual glory. They did it because they loved one another.\tThe Green Bay Packers never lost a football game. They just ran out of time.\tThe achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual.\tThe difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather in a lack of will.\tThe harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.\tThe leader can never close the gap between himself and the group. If he does, he is no longer what he must be. He must walk a tightrope between the consent he must win and the control he must exert.\tThe price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.\tThe quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor.\tThe spirit, the will to win, and the will to excel are the things that endure. These qualities are so much more important than the events that occur.\tThere is no room for second place. There is only one place in my game and that is first place. I have finished second twice in my time at Green Bay and I never want to finish second again.\tThere is only one way to succeed in anything and that is to give everything. I do and I demand that my players do. Any man's finest hour is when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle... victorious.\tWinners never quit, and quitters never win.\tWinning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.\tWinning is not a sometime thing; It's an all the time thing. You don't win once in a while; you don't do things right once in a while; you do them right all the time.\tWinning isn't everything, but wanting to win is.\tYou've got to be in top physical condition.
