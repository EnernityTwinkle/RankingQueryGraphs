People wish to be liked, not to be endured with patient resignation.\tA truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal world outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is.\tAdvocates of capitalism are very apt to appeal to the sacred principles of liberty, which are embodied in one maxim: The fortunate must not be restrained in the exercise of tyranny over the unfortunate.\tAll human activity is prompted by desire.\tAll movements go too far.\tAlthough this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation. When a man tells you that he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man.\tAn extra-terrestrial philosopher, who had watched a single youth up to the age of twenty-one and had never come across any other human being, might conclude that it is the nature of human beings to grow continually taller and wiser in an indefinite progress towards perfection; and this generalization would be just as well founded as the generalization which evolutionists base upon the previous history of this planet.\tAnything you're good at contributes to happiness.\tAristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men, by the simple device of asking Mrs. Aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted.\tBad philosophers may have a certain influence; good philosophers, never.\tBoredom is a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it.\tCan a society in which thought and technique are scientific persist for a long period, as, for example, ancient Egypt persisted, or does it necessarily contain within itself forces which must bring either decay or explosion?\tConventional people are roused to fury by departures from convention, largely because they regard such departures as a criticism of themselves.\tDo not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.\tDrunkenness is temporary suicide.\tEthics is in origin the art of recommending to others the sacrifices required for cooperation with oneself.\tEven when the experts all agree, they may well be mistaken.\tExtreme hopes are born from extreme misery.\tFear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.\tFew people can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation, or creed.\tFolly is perennial, yet the human race has survived.\tFor my part I distrust all generalizations about women, favorable and unfavorable, masculine and feminine, ancient and modern; all alike, I should say, result from paucity of experience.\tFreedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time.\tFreedom of opinion can only exist when the government thinks itself secure.\tHappiness is not best achieved by those who seek it directly.\tHatred of enemies is easier and more intense than love of friends. But from men who are more anxious to injure opponents than to benefit the world at large no great good is to be expected.\tI am paid by the word, so I always write the shortest words possible.\tI had supposed until that time that it was quite common for parents to love their children, but the war persuaded me that it is a rare exception. I had supposed that most people liked money better than almost anything else, but I discovered that they liked destruction even better. I had supposed that intellectuals frequently loved truth, but I found here again that not ten per cent of them prefer truth to popularity.\tIf a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this way.\tIf all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give.\tIf any philosopher had been asked for a definition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible rigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a definition that had any meaning at all.\tIf fifty million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.\tIf there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have paradise in a few years.\tIn America everybody is of opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors.\tIn all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.\tIn science men have discovered an activity of the very highest value in which they are no longer, as in art, dependent for progress upon the appearance of continually greater genius, for in science the successors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one man of supreme genius has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can apply it.\tIn the revolt against idealism, the ambiguities of the word experience have been perceived, with the result that realists have more and more avoided the word.\tIndignation is a submission of our thoughts, but not of our desires.\tIt is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living.\tIt is preoccupation with possessions, more than anything else, that prevents men from living freely and nobly.\tLife is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.\tMachines are worshipped because they are beautiful and valued because they confer power; they are hated because they are hideous and loathed because they impose slavery.\tMan is a credulous animal, and must believe something; in the absence of good grounds for belief, he will be satisfied with bad ones.\tMany people when they fall in love look for a little haven of refuge from the world, where they can be sure of being admired when they are not admirable, and praised when they are not praiseworthy.\tMany people would sooner die than think. In fact they do.\tMarriage is for women the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution.\tMathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.\tMathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme beauty a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.\tMen are born ignorant, not stupid; they are made stupid by education.\tMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth more than ruin more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.\tMen who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact.\tMost people would rather die than think: many do.\tNine-tenths of the appeal of pornography is due to the indecent feelings concerning sex which moralists inculcate in the young; the other tenth is physiological, and will occur in one way or another whatever the state of the law may be.\tNo matter how eloquently a dog may bark, he cannot tell you that his parents were poor, but honest.\tNo one gossips about other people's secret virtues.\tObscenity is whatever happens to shock some elderly and ignorant magistrate.\tOf all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.\tOne must care about a world one will not see.\tOne of the signs of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.\tOrganic life, we are told, has developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher, and this development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance. Unfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us this assurance.\tOur instinctive emotions are those that we have inherited from a much more dangerous world, and contain, therefore, a larger portion of fear than they should.\tPatriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.\tReal life is, to most men, a long second-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible; but the world of pure reason ;knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity.\tReason is a harmonizing, controlling force rather than a creative one.\tReligions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic.\tScience is what you know, philosophy what you don't know.\tSin is geographical.\tThe degree of one's emotions varies inversely with one's knowledge of the facts- the less you know the hotter you get.\tThe essence of the Liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held, but in how they are held: instead of being held dogmatically, they are held tentatively, and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment.\tThe fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics.\tThe fundamental defect with fathers is that they want their children to be a credit to them.\tThe good life is one inspired by life and guided by knowledge.\tThe good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life. I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy; I mean that if you are happy you will be good.\tThe life of man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long.\tThe main things which seem to me important on their own account, and not merely as a means to other account, and not merely as a means to other things, are knowledge, art instinctive happiness, and relations of friendship or affection.\tThe most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.\tThe most valuable things in life are not measured in monetary terms. The really important things are not houses and lands, stocks and bonds, automobiles and real state, but friendships, trust, confidence, empathy, mercy, love and faith.\tThe only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.\tThe opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holders lack of rational conviction. Opinions in politics and religion are almost always held passionately.\tThe root of the matter the thing I mean is love, Christian love, or compassion. If you feel this, you have a motive for existence, a guide for action, a reason for courage, an imperative necessity for intellectual honesty.\tThe secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.\tThe slave is doomed to worship time and fate and death, because they are greater than anything he finds in himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour.\tThe theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of philosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals, or to savages, or even to most civilized men.\tThe time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.\tThe trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent full of doubt.\tThe whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.\tThere is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.\tThere is no need to worry about mere size. We do not necessarily respect a fat man more than a thin man. Sir Isaac Newton was very much smaller than a hippopotamus, but we do not on that account value him less.\tThere is no nonsense so arrant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate government action.\tThere will still be things that machines cannot do. They will not produce great art or great literature or great philosophy; they will not be able to discover the secret springs of happiness in the human heart; they will know nothing of love and friendship.\tThis idea of weapons of mass exterminations utterly horrible and is something which no one with one spark of humanity can tolerate. I will not pretend to obey a government which is organizing a mass massacre of mankind.\tThose who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distorting medium of their own desires.\tThought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, the chief glory of man.\tThoughts is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit.\tThree passions simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life; the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.\tTo acquire immunity to eloquence is of the utmost importance to the citizens of a democracy.\tTo be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life slowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future.\tTo be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.\tTo conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.\tTo expect a personality to survive the disintegration of the brain is like expecting a cricket club to survive when all of its members are dead.\tTo fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.\tUnless one is taught what to do with success after getting it, achievement of it must inevitably leave him prey to boredom.\tWe are all prone to the malady of the introvert who, with the manifold spectacle of the world spread out before him, turns away and gazes only upon the emptiness within. But let us not imagine there is anything grand about the introvert's unhappiness.\tWe have in fact, two kinds of morality, side by side: one that we preach, but do not practice, and another that we practice, but seldom preach.\tWe know too much and feel too little. At least, we feel too little of those creative emotions from which a good life springs.\tWhat men want is not knowledge, but certainty.\tWhat we need is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out.\tWhen the intensity of emotional conviction subsides, a man who is in the habit of reasoning will search for logical grounds in favor of the belief which he finds in himself.\tWhy is propaganda so much more successful when it stirs up hatred than when it tries to stir up friendly feeling?\tWith the introduction of agriculture mankind entered upon a long period of meanness, misery, and madness, from which they are only now being freed by the beneficent operation of the machine.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 3, "m.01bpn", ["people.person.quotations"]]]}

Mathematica\"\" (1910-13).\tAmong Russell's Cambridge pupils was the Austrian philosopher Wittgenstein, whom Russell immediately recognised as a genius, and Weiner who was greatly influenced by Russell's mathematics.\tAmong the other members, who included the geographer Mackinder, only HG Wells appealed to him, and he resigned soon after joining.\tAt university he achieved First class honors in mathematics and philosophy and became a fellow of Trinity College in 1895 after presenting a dissertation on \"\"The Foundations of Geometry\"\".\tBetween the ages of two and four, Russell lost his mother, father and sister.\tBoth men accepted that they had not been able to show that all mathematics was derived from self-evident logical principles but the work was gradually accepted and it transformed the study of logic.\tBy now Russell had two young children and founded Beacon Hill, a co-educational school on the Sussex Downs based on progressive lines.\tDuring this time Russell published two popular science books, \"\"ABC of Atoms\"\" (1923) and \"\"ABC of Relativity\"\" (1925).\tHe also wrote two works on linguistic analysis, \"\"The Analysis of the Mind\"\" (1921) and \"\"The Analysis of Matter\"\" (1927), in which he applied his logical method to show the relation between mind and matter.\tHe clashed with old friends such as Gilbert Murray who supported the war and in 1915 wrote a pamphlet entitled \"\"The Policy of the Entente, 1904-1914, A Reply to Professor Gilbert Murray\"\".\tHe was a well-known public figure on both sides of the Atlantic and appeared in the work of  several authors, among them Lawrence and Eliot, the poet Sassoon and the novelist Aldous Huxley.\tHe was influenced by Mach.\tHe was put into the care of his grandfather Lord John Russell (who had twice been Prime Minister) and after his death two years later,  was brought up by Lady Russell.\tHe wrote \"\"Why I am not a Christian\"\"  (1927),  \"\"Marriage and Morals\"\" (1929) and \"\"Education and the Social Order\"\" (1932).\tIn 1896 the Russell's went to America where Russell lectured on the foundations of geometry.\tIn 1903 he wrote \"\"The Principles of Mathematics\"\".\tIn 1910 Russell took up a lectureship at Cambridge where Keynes, whom Russell had known since the beginning of the century, was using logical axioms as the basis for his work on probability.\tIn 1914 Russell went to lecture at Harvard in America where he met T S Eliot for the first time, and also the educational philosopher John Dewey.\tIn 1920 he visited Russia with a Labour party delegation and met both Trotsky and Lenin.\tIn 1935 Russell married Patricia Spence who had been employed as a governess for his children.\tIn 1938 he moved to the United States as visiting professor of philosophy at the Chicago and the University of Los Angeles before being appointed to the City College, New York where protests by parents who thought his moral views were dangerous were supported by the New York Supreme Court.\tIn the 1960's Russell opposed American policy in Vietnam and he attempted to establish a war crimes tribunal to indite Americans.\tOttoline introduced him to the writer  D H Lawrence with whom Russell formed a plan to write a series of political lectures which were eventually written by Russell in 1916 and published as \"\"Principles of Social Reconstruction\"\".\tOver the following decade Russell constructed a new logical foundation for mathematics.\tRussell believed that by logical analysis, knowledge can be revealed as 'atomic facts' that are logically independent of each other and of being known.\tRussell came away disillusioned and expressed his views in  \"\"The Practice and Theory of Communism\"\" (1920), thus annoying many left-wingers who had previously seen him as their champion.\tRussell had moved away from the idealism of his early university career to materialism and what he came to call his philosophy of logical atomism, a philosophy which became one of the sources of twentieth-century logical positivism.\tRussell inherited the earldom of Amberley on his brother's death in 1931.\tRussell joined the Co-Efficients, a dining club founded by Sydney Webb to discuss the problems of the British Empire.\tRussell then lectured at the Barnes foundation near Philadelphia where he wrote his \"\"History of Western Philosophy\"\" (1945).\tRussell was a pacifist during the first World War and he was a provocative advocate of the cause.\tRussell was a pioneer of logical positivism and lingistic analysis but cannot be fully identified with either disciipline.\tRussell was interested in left wing politics, supported womens' suffrage and was a member of the Fabian Society.\tRussell was later much admired by younger philosophers such as Carnap.\tRussell's ethical position was that moral judgements are not rational assessments but merely based on feeling and desire.\tRussell's parents were anti-establishment, adopted utilitarian ethics and appointed John Stuart Mill^ as Russell's 'godfather'.\tSix years later he met the American writer Gertrude Stein at the  house of the philosopher Whitehead where Russell's criticism of American society and culture triggered Stein to write: \"\"The Making of Americans\"\".\tThe American psychologist Skinner was influenced by Russell's writings on behaviorism.\tThe following year, Russell began his long love affair with Lady Ottoline Morrell, the society hostess, through whom Russell extended his social life beyond Cambridge and politics.\tThis had already been attempted by Frege whose work was read by Russell.\tThis is the work for which Russell is famous and which ranks as one of the most significant works on the history of mathematics.\tThis strengthened his desire to prove that mathematics existed independently outside the mind of mathematicians, and that a system of logic could be developed which would allow every mathematical proposition to be deduced from it.\tTo finance the project Russell wrote articles in the popular press and undertook lecture tours in which he offended traditionalists by proclaiming his unconventional views on sex and marriage.\tTogether with his wife, he visited Germany to study socialist politics and on his return gave a series of lectures on German Social Democracy to the LSE
