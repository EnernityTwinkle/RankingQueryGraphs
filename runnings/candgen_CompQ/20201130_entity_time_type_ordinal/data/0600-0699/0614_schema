We've seen it all before.\"\"\tA Bay Area Bisexual told me I didn't quite coincide with either of her desires.\tAfter mature deliberation of counsel, the good Queen to establish a rule and immutable example unto all posterity, for the moderation and required modesty in a lawful marriage, ordained the number of six times a day as a lawful, necessary and competent limit.\tAll this fuss about sleeping together. For physical pleasure I'd sooner go to my dentist any day.\tAny woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke. That's their natural and first weapon. She will need her sisterhood.\tEmbraces are cominglings from the head even to the feet, and not a pompous high priest entering by a secret place.\tFor once you must try not to shirk the facts: mankind is kept alive by bestial acts.\tFor those for whom the sex act has come to seem mechanical and merely the meeting and manipulation of body parts, there often remains a hunger which can be called metaphysical but which is not recognized as such, and which seeks satisfaction in physical danger, or sometimes in torture, suicide, or murder.\tI am sure no other civilization, not even the Romans, has showed such a vast proportion of ignominious and degraded nudity, and ugly, squalid dirty sex. Because no other civilization has driven sex into the underworld, and nudity to the W.C.\tI believe that organic sex, body against body, skin area against skin area, is becoming no longer possible, simply because if anything is to have any meaning for us it must take place in terms of the values and experiences of the media landscape. What we're getting is a whole new order of sexual fantasies, involving a different order of experiences, like car crashes, like travelling in jet aircraft, the whole overlay of new technologies, architecture, interior design, communications, transport, merchandising. These things are beginning to reach into our lives and change the interior design of our sexual fantasies. We've got to recognize that what one sees through the window of the TV screen is as important as what one sees through a window on the street.\tI can live without it all -- love with its blood pump, sex with its messy hungers, men with their peacock strutting, their silly sexual baggage, their wet tongues in my ear.\tI have urged on woman independence of man, not that I do not think the sexes mutually needed by one another, but because in woman this fact has led to an excessive devotion, which has cooled love, degraded marriage and prevented it her sex from being what it should be to itself or the other. I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty. Then if she finds what she needs in man embodied, she will know how to love and be worthy of being loved.\tI never miss a chance to have sex or appear on television.\tI've tried several varieties of sex. The conventional position makes me claustrophobic and the others give me a stiff neck or lockjaw.\tIf any of us hopes to survive, s/he must meet the extremity of the American female condition with immediate and political response. The thoroughly destructive and indefensible subjugation of the majority of Americans cannot continue except at the peril of the entire body politic.\tIf the devil were to offer me a resurgence of what is commonly called virility, I'd decline. Just keep my liver and lungs in good working order, I'd reply, so I can go on drinking and smoking!\tIn particular I may mention Sophocles the poet, who was once asked in my presence, How do you feel about love, Sophocles? are you still capable of it? to which he replied, Hush! if you please: to my great delight I have escaped from it, and feel as if I had escaped from a frantic and savage master. I thought then, as I do now, that he spoke wisely. For unquestionably old age brings us profound repose and freedom from this and other passions.\tInevitably we look upon society, so kind to you, so harsh to us, as an ill-fitting form that distorts the truth; deforms the mind; fetters the will.\tIntercourse with a woman is sometimes a satisfactory substitute for masturbation. But it takes a lot of imagination to make it work.\tIt is true from early habit, one must make love mechanically as one swims; I was once very fond of both, but now as I never swim unless I tumble into the water, I don't make love till almost obliged.\tMarital intercourse is certainly holy, lawful and praiseworthy in itself and profitable to society, yet in certain circumstances it can prove dangerous, as when through excess the soul is made sick with venial sin, or through the violation and perversion of its primary end, killed by mortal sin; such perversion, detestable in proportion to its departure from the true order, being always mortal sin, for it is never lawful to exclude the primary end of marriage which is the procreation of children.\tMuch more than our other needs and endeavors, it is sexuality that puts us on an even footing with our kind: the more we practice it, the more we become like everyone else: it is in the performance of a reputedly bestial function that we prove our status as citizens: nothing is more public than the sexual act.\tMuch of the ill-tempered railing against women that has characterized the popular writing of the last two years is a half-hearted attempt to find a way back to a more balanced relationship between our biological selves and the world we have built. So women are scolded both for being mothers and for not being mothers, for wanting to eat their cake and have it too, and for not wanting to eat their cake and have it too.\tNo man can call himself liberal, or radical, or even a conservative advocate of fair play, if his work depends in any way on the unpaid or underpaid labor of women at home, or in the office.\tNo woman needs intercourse; few women escape it.\tOf all the sexual aberrations, perhaps the most peculiar is chastity.\tSex -- the great inequality, the great miscalculator, the great Irritator.\tSex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional and be genuinely regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.\tSex is a conversation carried out by other means. If you get on well out of bed, half the problems of bed are solved.\tSex is as important as eating or drinking and we ought to allow the one appetite to be satisfied with as little restraint or false modesty as the other.\tSex is like money; only too much is enough.\tSex is more exciting on the screen and between the pages than between the sheets.\tSex is one of the nine reasons for reincarnation. The other eight are unimportant.\tSex is the last refuge of the miserable.\tSex is the most fun you can have without laughing.\tSex is the mysticism of materialism and the only possible religion in a materialistic society.\tSex is. There is nothing more to be done about it. Sex builds no roads, writes no novels and sex certainly gives no meaning to anything in life but itself.\tSex pleasure in woman is a kind of magic spell; it demands complete abandon; if words or movements oppose the magic of caresses, the spell is broken.\tSex without love is an empty experience, but as empty experiences go it's one of the best.\tSex. In America an obsession. In other parts of the world a fact.\tSexism is the foundation on which all tyranny is built. Every social form of hierarchy and abuse is modeled on male-over-female domination.\tSexual love is undoubtedly one of the chief things in life, and the union of mental and bodily satisfaction in the enjoyment of love is one of its culminating peaks. Apart from a few queer fanatics, all the world knows this and conducts its life accordingly; science alone is too delicate to admit it.\tSkill makes love unending.\tThat our popular art forms have become so obsessed with sex has turned the U.S.A into a nation of hobbledehoys; as if grown people don't have more vital concerns, such as taxes, inflation, dirty politics, earning a living, getting an education, or keeping out of jail.\tThe act of sex, gratifying as it may be, is God's joke on humanity. It is man's last desperate stand at superintendency.\tThe law of God, as quite plainly expressed in woman's construction, is this: There shall be no limit put upon your intercourse with the other sex sexually, at any time of life. During twenty-three days in every month (in the absence of pregnancy) from the time a woman is seven years old till she dies of old age, she is ready for action, and competent. As competent as the candlestick is to receive the candle. Competent every day, competent every night. Also, she wants that candle -- yearns for it, longs for it, hankers after it, as commanded by the law of God in her heart.\tThe misogyny that shapes every aspect of our civilization is the institutionalized form of male fear and hatred of what they have denied and therefore cannot know, cannot share: that wild country, the being of women.\tThe more developed sexual passion, in both sexes, is very largely an emotion of power, domination, or appropriation. There is no state of feeling that says mine, mine, more fiercely.\tThe question of sexual dominance can exist only in the nightmare of that soul which has armed itself, totally, against the possibility of the changing motion of conquest and surrender, which is love.\tThere comes a moment in the day when you have written your pages in the morning, attended to your correspondence in the afternoon, and have nothing further to do. Then comes that hour when you are bored; that's the time for sex.\tThere goes a saying, and 'twas shrewdly said, Old fish at table, but young flesh in bed.\tThere is nothing safe about sex. There never will be.\tWe do not go to bed in single pairs; even if we choose not to refer to them, we still drag there with us the cultural impedimenta of our social class, our parents lives, our bank balances, our sexual and emotional expectations, our whole biographies -- all the bits and pieces of our unique existences.\tWe must reckon with the possibility that something in the nature of the sexual instinct itself is unfavorable to the realization of complete satisfaction.\tWe should teach general ethics to both men and women, but sexual relationships themselves must not be policed. Sex, like the city streets, would be risk-free only in totalitarian regimes.\tWhat holds the world together, as I have learned from bitter experience, is sexual intercourse.\tWhat more fiendish proof of cosmic irresponsibility than a Nature which, having invented sex as a way to mix genes, then permits to arise, amid all its perfumed and hypnotic inducements to mate, a tireless tribe of spirochetes and viruses that torture and kill us for following orders?\tWhoever named it necking is a poor judge of anatomy.\tYou have to accept the fact that part of the sizzle of sex comes from the danger of sex. You can be overpowered.\tYou have to see the sex act comically, as a child.\t\u201cI see all sorts of things when I\u2019m clearing my pipes.\u201d", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.06ng1", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
