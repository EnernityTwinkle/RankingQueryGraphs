This is not good at all. I am just like everybody else.\tAny cook should be able to run the country.\tAuthority poisons everybody who takes authority on himself.\tCapitalists are no more capable of self-sacrifice than a man is capable of lifting himself up by his own bootstraps.\tCommunism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.\tDespair is typical of those who do not understand the causes of evil, see no way out, and are incapable of struggle. The modern industrial proletariat does not belong to the category of such classes.\tFreedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.\tGive me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.\tGive us the child for 8 years and it will be a Bolshevik forever.\tI am a bad, wicked man, but I am practicing moral self-purification; I don't eat meat any more, I now eat rice cutlets.\tIf Socialism can only be realized when the intellectual development of all the people permits it, then we shall not see Socialism for at least five hundred years.\tIt is necessary to be able to withstand all this, to agree to any and every sacrifice, and evenif need beto resort to all sorts of stratagems, manoeuvres and illegal methods, to evasion and subterfuges in order to penetrate the trade unions, to remain in them, and to carry on Communist work in them at all costs.\tIt is true that liberty is precious.

Wells in 1921.\tHowever, a government informer soon infiltrated the group, and in December 1895 the leaders of the Union were arrested.\tHowever, his health had been in decline since an assassination attempt in 1918, and in late 1922 he suffered a serious stroke.\tIn 1902, however, the owner of the Munich printing plant refused to produce any more copies of 'Iskra', so Lenin moved to London, where he met an important future collaborator, Trotsky, and published probably his most important work: 'What is to be done?' The work created significant divisions between many of his close allies, particularly his conception of a highly disciplined centralized party that would, presumably under his leadership, lead the proletariat to revolution.\tIn 1921 he worked out a plan for the construction of socialism and developed the principles of his New Economic Policy, which emphasized economic reconstruction and education, and allowed a limited amount of free enterprise in order to give Russia respite before entering the era of giant state planning.\tIn August 1893, Lenin moved to St. Petersburg where he nominally practised as a public defender, but concentrated most of his efforts on developing links with other revolutionary Marxists, one of whom was his future wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya.\tIn December 1907, Lenin was forced to flee from the Tsar's secret police, and he remained abroad for the next decade, studying works by political, military and industrial theorists (from Clausewitz's 'On War', 1832-34 to Taylor's 'Principles of Scientific Management', 1911), while developing and promoting the cause of a Russian Bolshevik revolution.\tIn June 1905 the famous Potemkin naval revolt took place, by October there was a general strike, and in mid-October the Tsar felt compelled to grant certain civil liberties and to establish a Duma (parliament).\tIn March 1895 Lenin developed pneumonia, but a month later had sufficiently recovered to leave Russia for Switzerland, where he intended to make contact with Russian political exiles.\tLenin concluded peace with Germany in 1918, and then commanded the Bolsheviks in the ensuing civil war (1918-21), during which he fought off both the White Army and foreign intervention, despite the anarchy and widespread starvation afflicting Russia.\tLenin produced the newspaper, printed secretly and then smuggled into Russia, in the hope that its message would unify and strengthen the disparate Russian revolutionary movements.\tLenin studied revolutionary political literature favoured by his brother, including the work of  Moses Hess, and  Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital'  and became committed to Marxism.\tLenin was jailed for 14 months in an open prison from where he continued to correspond with revolutionaries, engineer strikes and walk-outs, and began writing his first major work, 'The Development of Capitalism in Russia.' In February 1897, Lenin was exiled to Siberia for three years, where he was joined by his fianc\u017de, Nadezhda Krupskaya, whom he married in July 1898.\tLenin was then elected head of the Soviet Government, and on 11 March 1918, together with the Party Central Committee and the Soviet Government, he moved to Moscow, which then became the capital of the Soviet state.\tMeanwhile Lenin, who had vigorously opposed the war as an imperialist struggle between competing groups of capitalists that should in Russia be converted into civil war, had managed to persuade officials in the German government that, should he come to power, he would withdraw Russia from the war.\tMeanwhile, Lenin had returned to Russia in October and took charge of the Bolsheviks, but he remained convinced that the time for revolution had not yet come.\tMeanwhile, Russia remained at war and as morale worsened, Lenin - supported by Trotsky (now his second-in-command), Stalin and Molotov - developed a plan for the proletariat to seize power by means of an armed uprising.\tMeanwhile, in Russia conditions were worsening, with resentment against Tsar Nicholas II and the government made worse by Russian losses in the Russo-Japanese War.\tMoving from  Finland (1906), to Geneva (1908), where he established another newspaper, 'Proletary' ('The Proletarian'), and then Paris (1909), where two years later he set up a school for the training of underground revolutionaries, in 1910 Lenin met the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky in Capri, who became an important supporter and sponsor of the Bolsheviks In 1916 Lenin moved to Zurich.\tOn release from his exile in 1900, Lenin travelled to Pskov and from there into self-imposed exile in western Europe where, in association with Russian Marxists abroad, he was to spend the next five years devoting himself to revolutionary activity.\tOne of the most important and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was a powerful orator, fluent in many languages, and wrote several major studies of socialist theory.\tShortly afterwards the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was organized, and from then until March 1923, Lenin dictated a series of articles which became his formal legacy to the Communist Party and the Russian people.\tThen, late in February 1917, the situation in Russia again altered dramatically, when a spontaneous uprising against the Tsar by crowds in Petrograd (formerly St. Petersburg) was joined by most of the Petrograd garrison and became the first (February, or bourgeois-democratic) Russian Revolution.\tThen, on 24 October, Lenin arrived at Smolny and took charge of the October Revolution, during which the provisional government was overthrown and Lenin declared the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and the formation of the Congress of Soviets.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 3, "m.05wh0sh", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}

with which went the supreme command of the armed forces of the Reich - and all officers and ministers took an oath of allegiance to Hitler personally.\tBy July 1933, Hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the Communists, Social Democrats and Jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps.\tBy November 1923 Hitler was convinced that the Weimar Republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with Ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich.\tConvinced that the natural field of expansion for German Lebensraum lay eastwards, on 1 September 1939 German armies invaded Poland (the independence of which was guaranteed by Britain and France), and two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany.\tDuring the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, Hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in Germany, and helped (along with Goebbels' propaganda) Germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of German life, enforced by Himmler's Secret State Police (Gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and Jews, who were systematically persecuted.\tDuring the years 1930-33 Hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in Germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher Heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian Spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'Landbund', or League of Land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the Weimar Republic.\tDuring this Vienna period (1907-13), Hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-Semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in Austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, Lanz von Liebenfels (whose theory of \"\"Theozoology\"\" divided humanity into two groups - Aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the Austrian Pan-German leader, Georg von Schoenerer.\tFrom January 1945 Hitler never left the chancellery bunker in Berlin.\tFrom his experiences, Hitler had now learned that the road to power lay not through force alone, but through legal subversion of the Weimar Constitution, and he set out to build a mass movement empowered by a combination of parliamentary strength and extra-parliamentary street terror and intimidation.\tFrom the first, Hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly General Ludwig Beck, chief of the general staff) that Germany was not strong enough to defeat the Allied powers.\tFrom these Hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his Socialist and Communist opponents.\tFrom these and other sources, the young Hitler began to construct a vision of the world in which Jews (by race, rather than by religion) became the symbol and cause of all chaos, corruption, and destruction in culture, politics and the economy, and that the press, prostitution, syphilis, capitalism, Marxism, democracy and pacificism were all means exploited by 'the Jew' in his conspiracy to undermine the German nation and the purity of the creative Aryan race.\tHad political connection with Benes.\tHe  directed Himmler to prepare the ground for the \"\"New Order\"\" in Europe, and the concentration camps in Poland were expanded, in preparation for what had now become a policy of the liquidation of all Jews under German rule.\tHe also began preparing for the war of revenge he had promised in 'Mein Kampf.'  In 1935 he abandoned the Versailles Treaty, re-establishing universal military service, building a powerful air force, and persuading the British to sign a naval treaty recognizing Germany's right to rearm.\tHe quickly showed a marked talent for inflammatory speaking, political agitation and party organization.\tHe refused to read reports of defeats, and those close to him, especially his secretary Martin Bormann, took care that only positive information reached him.\tHe then spent four years at the Linz Realschule, followed by a period at a boarding school in Steyr.\tHe then turned his attention to the Balkans and North Africa, where his Italian allies had suffered defeats, and the German armies rapidly overran Greece, Yugoslavia, the island of Crete and Cyrenaica.\tHe was badly gassed four weeks before the end of the war and, temporarily blinded, spent three months recuperating in a hospital in Pomerania   During the war Hitler had found comradeship, discipline, and participation in conflict intensely satisfying, and in November 1918 learned with horror of Germany's defeat,  and of the humiliation of the armistice arranged  by the 'big three':  Lloyd George (UK) , Clemenceau (France) and Woodrow Wilson (US).\tHis 'Third Reich', which was to have endured forever, ended after twelve years of unparalleled brutality, in which 30 million people lost their lives, twelve million of them far from the battlefields:  by mass shootings, in forced labour camps and in the gas ovens of Belsen, Dachau, Auschwitz, Ravensbruck and other concentration camps in accordance with Nazi racial theories.\tHis anti-Jewish laws caused physicist Born to be fired.\tHis narrow escape convinced him that he had been chosen by God to lead the German people, and he drastically reduced the army's independence, appointing National Socialist political officers to all military positions.\tHitler attended a primary school in Braunau for five years, and then moved with his family to Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, on his father's retirement in 1897.\tHitler escaped with only minor injuries, however, and ordered the execution of all those implicated.\tHitler failed to succeed in his studies and left school in 1905 to become a painter.\tHitler left the army in 1920, and became party propagandist, editing the party newspaper the 'Volkischer Beobachter' ('People's Observer'), arranging frequent meetings, changing the name of the party to the National-sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (the National Socialist German Workers' Party, NSDAP or Nazi Party), imposing himself as its Chairman by July 1921, and giving the new Party its symbol - the swastika - and its greeting, 'Heil!'.\tHitler was tried on 26 February 1924 and  sentenced to five years imprisonment at Landberg fortress.\tHowever, he was released after only nine months, during which he dictated to Hess his autobiography and personal testament 'Mein Kampf' ('My Struggle'),  published in 1925 and which by 1939 had sold five million copies, making Hitler a wealthy man.\tHowever, the depression of 1929 enhanced the appeal for the Nazis, and Hitler found support among wealthy industrialists keen to finance a strong right-wing, anti-democratic government, which at last placed the Party on a secure financial footing.\tIn 1936, he occupied and fortified the Rhineland,  with the Italian dictator Mussolini began sending military aid to Franco's fascist forces in Spain, and in October 1936 forged the Rome- Berlin Axis.\tIn August 1914 he enlisted in the Sixteenth Bavarian Infantry Regiment, serving as a despatch runner on the Western front.\tIn August 1939, Hitler and Stalin signed a nonaggression pact,  freeing Hitler to turn his full attention to Western Europe.\tIn December 1944 he moved his headquarters to Berlin, where he directed the German offensive in the Ardennes.\tIn February 1938, he dismissed 16 senior generals and took personal command of the armed forces.\tIn July 1943 the Allies captured Sicily and Mussolini's regime collapsed in Italy.\tIn June 1934, Hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the SA and its leader, Captain Ernst Rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms.\tIn March 1938, he forced Austria into 'Anschluss' (political union) with Germany, making a triumphantal entry into Vienna.\tIn May 1913, Hitler left Vienna for Munich, Germany in order to avoid military training in Austria.\tIn September 1943, the Allies invaded Italy, and then Normandy, France in June 1944.\tIn the 1932 elections, just after becoming a German citizen, Hitler opposed the aging Hindenburg in the presidential election, taking  36.8 percent of the vote on the second ballot and depriving von Hindenburg of the necessary absolute majority.\tInfluenced by theories of Mackinder and Gobineau.\tOn 29 April, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, Hitler married his long-term mistress Eva Braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed Admiral Donitz as head of state and Goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"\"Above all, I charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international Jewry.\"\" The following day, Hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the Reich Chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, Trevor-Roper's^:  'The Last Days of Hitler', 1947).\tOn 29 July 1944 came the last of several attempts to assassinate Hitler when Colonel  von Stauffenberg exploded a time bomb at a conference at Hitler's field headquarters.\tOn 29 September 1938, Hitler and Mussolini met at Munich with the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, who agreed to the bloodless surrender of the Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia, and in March 1939 German troops entered Prague and the absorption of Czechoslovakia was complete.\tOn his release, Hitler began to rebuild the Nazi Party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of Goering, Hess and Goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival Nazi leader, Gregor Strasser.\tOn leaving hospital, Hitler returned to Munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist German Workers' Party (DAP), which Hitler joined in September 1919.\tOut of this grew the storm troopers (SA), organized in 1921 by Captain Ernst Rohm, and Hitler's black-shirt personal bodyguard force, the 'Schutzstaffel' (SS).\tSoon a million Allied troops were driving the German allies eastwards, while the Soviets came from the opposite direction.\tThe Battle of Britain, in which the Royal Air Force denied the Luftwaffe aerial control over the English Channel, was Hitler's first setback, and in October 1940 he cancelled the invasion code- named  Operation Sea Lion.\tThe Nazi Party adopted the ideas Hitler had acquired in Vienna - violent racial nationalism, anti-Semitism and opposition to liberal democracy, combined with perverted versions of the philosophies of such German thinkers as Haeckel and Nietzsche - combined with a hatred of the post-war republican German government and 'socialistic' ideas of profit-sharing and nationalization.\tThe attack against the U.S.S.R., racially and ideologically justified by Hitler as an anti- Bolshevik anti-Jewish crusade, was finally launched on 22 June 1941, with Hitler so confident of success that he announced it would be over in six weeks, and refused to provide winter clothing and equipment for his troops.\tThe first phase of World War II was dominated by German 'Blitzkrieg' tactics - sudden shock attacks against airfields, communications, military installations, using fast mobile armour and infantry to follow up the first wave of bomber and fighter aircraft,  through which Poland was overrun in 19 days, Denmark and Norway in two months, and Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France in six weeks.\tThe mid-1920s saw a period of economic stability in Germany, and while in January 1925 the ban on the party was removed in Bavaria, allowing Hitler to speak in public, elsewhere prohibitions remained in force until 1927-28, and the Nazi Party won only 12 seats in the 1928 elections.\tThen, in spite of a decline in the party's votes to 11 million in November 1932, Hitler was helped to power by a deal with former Chancellor Papen, in which they secretly agreed to work together for a government in which Hitler would be chancellor and Papen's conservative supporters would hold important ministeries.\tThis widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove Hitler to implement the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question' which had been under consideration since 1939.\tWhen it failed, he clutched at fantastic hopes that his 'secret weapons', the V-1 and V-2 rockets, would turn the tide of war.\tWith the failure of the British campaign, Hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 4, "m.07_m9_", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
