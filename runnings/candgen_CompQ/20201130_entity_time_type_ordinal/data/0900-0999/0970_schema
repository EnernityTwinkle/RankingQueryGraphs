And when she is a woman he turns her back again.\tA man knows when he is growing old because he begins to look like his father.\tAn angry father is most cruel toward himself.\tAn unforgiving eye, and a damned disinheriting countenance!\tAs fathers commonly go, it is seldom a misfortune to be fatherless; and considering the general run of sons, as seldom a misfortune to be childless.\tBlessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him father!\tBy profession I am a soldier and take pride in that fact. But I am prouder -- infinitely prouder -- to be a father. A soldier destroys in order to build; the father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentiality of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son, when I am gone, will remember me not from the battle field but in the home repeating with him our simple daily prayer, Our Father Who Art in Heaven.\tCall no man your father upon the earth, for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\tFathers do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. -- Ephesians 6:4\tFathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.\tHe who is taught to live upon little owes more to his father's wisdom than he who has a great deal left him does to his father's care.\tI cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection.\tI stopped loving my father a long time ago. What remained was the slavery to a pattern.\tIf the new American father feels bewildered and even defeated, let him take comfort from the fact that whatever he does in any fathering situation has a fifty percent chance of being right.\tIt is a wise father that knows his own child.\tIt no longer bothers me that I may be constantly searching for father figures; by this time, I have found several and dearly enjoyed knowing them all.\tMen are generally more careful of the breed of their horses and dogs than of their children.\tMy father must have had some elementary education for he could read and write and keep accounts inaccurately\tNoble fathers have noble children.\tNone of you can ever be proud enough of being the child of SUCH a Father who has not his equal in this world -- so great, so good, so faultless. Try, all of you, to follow in his footsteps and don't be discouraged, for to be really in everything like him none of you, I am sure, will ever be. Try, therefore, to be like him in some points, and you will have acquired a great deal.\tOne father is more than a hundred schoolmasters.\tOne night a father overheard his son pray: Dear God, Make me the kind of man my Daddy is. Later that night, the Father prayed, Dear God, Make me the kind of man my son wants me to be.\tThat he delights in the misery of others no man will confess, and yet what other motive can make a father cruel?\tThat is the thankless position of the father in the family -- the provider for all, and the enemy of all.\tThe American father is never seen in London. He passes his life entirely in Wall Street and communicates with his family once a month by means of a telegram in cipher.\tThe father who does not teach his son his duties is equally guilty with the son who neglects them.\tThe fundamental defect with fathers is that they want their children to be a credit to them.\tThe thing to remember about fathers is, they're men. A girl has to keep it in mind: They are dragon-seekers, bent on improbable rescues. Scratch any father, you find someone chock-full of qualms and romantic terrors, believing change is a threat -- like your first shoes with heels on, like your first bicycle I it took such months to get.\tThe worst misfortune that can happen to an ordinary man is to have an extraordinary father.\tThere are fathers who do not love their children, but there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson.\tThose who have never had a father can at any rate never know the sweets of losing one. To most men the death of his father is a new lease of life.\tTo a father growing old nothing is dearer than a daughter.\tTo be a successful father... there's one absolute rule: when you have a kid, don't look at it for the first two years.\tWhat harsh judges fathers are to all young men!\tWhen one has not had a good father, one must create one.", "answer_type": "media_common.quotation", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 5, "m.0lbxg", ["media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject"]]]}
