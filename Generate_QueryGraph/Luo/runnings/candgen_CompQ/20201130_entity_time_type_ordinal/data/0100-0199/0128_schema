Gilbert was not interested in electricity as such, and only introduced the subject to show that it was not connected with magnetism.\tHe was appointed physician to the queen's successor, James I, but Gilbert died, probably of the plague, before taking up the appointment.\tHe was consulted by the geographer Hakluyt and he attended Cecil, the queen's first minister, on his death bed.\tHe was one of the doctors selected to advise the Privy Council on an outbreak of disease in the city of London, and on the health of men serving in the navy.\tHe was the first to use the terms 'electric attraction' and 'electric forces' and his research was later repeated by Stephen Gray.\tHis book was recognised both in England and abroad.\tHis unpublished writings were edited by his half-brother William and published in Amsterdam after his death.\tIn 1587 he became treasurer of the Royal College of Physicians.\tIn 1600 he became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\tIn 1601 Gilbert was appointed physician in ordinary to Queen Elizabeth and was probably one of the doctors in attendance at her death in 1603.\tIn his book he summarized existing knowledge on magnetism before investigating the properties of the magnet, illustrated by diagrams and experiment.\tIn the same year, he was granted the right to have his own coat of arms, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.\tThe dip of the needle from the horizontal had been found to vary at different places and sailors had begun to collect data on this.\tThe first to subject the study of magnetism to the new scientific method of experimental observation.\tThe poet laureate Dryden later wrote that: \"\"Gilbert shall live till loadstones cease to draw, Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe\"\".\tThe same year he published the work on magnetism for which he is remembered.\tThe value of Gilbert's work lay in the fact that he put the study of magnetism on a scientific basis and gave detailed experimental data.\tWalsingham, Queen Elizabeth's spymaster, would grant permission to travel abroad for health reasons on receipt of a medical certificate signed by Gilbert.\tWithin the next decade, he became a prominent member of his profession and numbered among his patients members of the government and the aristocracy.", "answer_type": "", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 2, "m.015zm_", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
