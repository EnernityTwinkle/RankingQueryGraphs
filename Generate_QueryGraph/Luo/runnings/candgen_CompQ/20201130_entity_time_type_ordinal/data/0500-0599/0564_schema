24-year-old philosopher Nietzsche ,  the newly-installed Professor of Philology at the University of Basel, Switzerland.\tAt one point, Cosima, von Bulow  and Wagner all lived in the same house.\tBy 1920, she had become blind.\tCosima Liszt was the second of Liszt's three illegitimate children by his mistress Marie d'Agoult.\tCosima and Wagner were married in 1870.\tCosima and von Bulow had their first daughter, Daniela, in 1860.\tCosima at first wanted to maintain the marriage, but in 1868, left von Bulow to live with Wagner in Lucerne, taking her four daughters with her.\tCosima took him to Venice, where they moved into the Palazzo Vendramin on the Grand Canal in September, 1882.\tCosima took over the directorship of the regular Bayreuth Festivals.\tCosima was deeply involved with the preparations and rehearsals.\tCosima's devotion to Wagner was fundamental to the completion of many of his operas, particularly \"\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\"\" and \"\"Parsifal\"\".\tCosima, who had been present at the concert, decided to wait up for him at home.\tHe was exhausted after the rigors of his work and Wagner's presence made him feel inferior and futile.\tIn 1855, alarmed that Marie d'Agoult was starting to show some interest in her children,  Liszt put Blandine and Cosima (now 19 and 17) in the charge of a friend, Franziska von Bulow.\tIn 1859, Wagner had asked her to translate \"\"Tannh\u00e4user\"\" into French for the Paris production of 1861 , but she never completed the task.\tIn 1863 they met again when they took a carriage together alone,  and declared their affection to each other.\tIn 1908, she handed over directorship to her son Siegfried.\tIn the early 1860s, while living in Berlin, Cosima became a regular contributor to a Parisian magazine, \"\"La Revue Germanique\"\", for which she wrote political articles, and also translated a number of German works into French.\tIn the same year, Wagner composed the \"\"Siegfried Idyll\"\" to commemorate the birth of their son, Siegfried.\tInvited Isadora Duncan to dance at the Festival.\tIt appears Cosima was now falling in love with Wagner, but her next visit in the summer of 1858 was  equally difficult because Wagner was  in the throes of a domestic row with his wife, Minna, over the wife of his benefactor, Mathilde Wesendonck.\tIt was an enormous  task, and the Second Bayreuth Festival did not take place until the summer of 1882, when Wagner finished \"\"Parsifal\"\".\tIt was not until 1862 that Cosima's relationship with Wagner blossomed.\tMet artist Burne-Jones.\tNietzsche spent much of the summer of 1869 with them and the three developed a close relationship that lasted until the Franco-Prussian War (1870-72) caused major disagreements among them.\tRecently divorced from her husband, von Bulow was living in poverty in Berlin with her son Hans, a former pupil of Liszt, and her daughter Isa.\tShe applied her characteristic energies and was the moving force behind the festival in both commercial and social matters, influencing the selection of repertory, artists, and style of presentation.\tShe continued her devotion to Wagner's works.\tShe prayed for death, but in fact lived another 47 years.\tShe was unable to attend the huge public funeral, but attended the internment at the tomb at Wahnfried.\tThat summer, von Bulow and Cosima stayed with Wagner in Biebrich, on the Rhine, where Wagner had begun to write  \"\"Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg\"\".\tThe Wagner's also had built a huge house in the town, Wahnfried.\tThe first thing Hans did after the wedding was take his 19-year-old bride to visit Wagner in Zurich.\tThe foundation stone for the Bayreuth theater was laid with much celebration on May 22, 1872, and the theater was ready for the First Bayreuth Festival in the summer of 1876.\tThe romance between Hans von Bulow and Cosima had a bizarre beginning.\tThey stayed there all winter, but in February, 1883, Wagner died in her arms.\tTo improve their social graces, the three children were sent from their grandmother to her former Russian governess, the aged Madame Patersi de Fossombroni and her sister, Madame Saint-Mars.\tTwo years later they were married.\tVon Bulow also arranged for Wagner to conduct in St Gallen in 1850.\tVon Bulow had been Wagner's  musical sponsor before Liszt, and had encouraged Wagner to defy his parents, abandon his legal studies, and become a musician.\tVon Bulow learned the full extent of his wife's affair only in 1866,  and his relationship with Cosima became strained.\tVon Bulow was hissed after conducting Wagner's \"\"Tannh\u00e4user\"\" Overture, and was so demoralized he fainted in his dressing-room.\tVon Bulow was in a depressed state.\tWagner declared later that at the end of this visit, he began to have feelings for Cosima, he began to detect in her the free and unconventional spirit he had been looking for in a woman.\tWagner had decided to separate from his wife, mainly to pursue an affair with Mathilde Maier.\tWagner had moved to the city the month before, and Cosima's relationship with him continued.\tWagner had no notion of Cosima's feelings for him.\tWagner was now suffering from a diseased heart and the effort of the festival exhausted him.\tWagner's death utterly destroyed Cosima.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 1, "m.02y7fx",
