Arnold, he helped to speed up American military air preparations.\tAt the request of the U.S. government, in December 1927 Lindbergh also flew to various Latin-American countries as a symbol of American good will.\tBetween 1931 and 1935, working with the French surgeon and biologist Carrel, whose research included experiments in keeping organs alive outside the body, Lindbergh invented an \"\"artificial heart\"\", a special sterilizing glass perfusion pump that could be used to circulate nutrient fluid around large excised organs in a moist chamber in a laboratory, and he eventually published, with Carrel, 'The Culture of Organs' (1938).\tBy 1927, it had still not been won, although the well-known explorer and aviator Byrd (who in 1926 had made his name with the first aeroplane flight across the North Pole with Floyd Bennett) was known to be constructing a Fokker tri-motor airplane with which to attempt an Atlantic crossing, and early that year Lindbergh persuaded nine St. Louis businessmen to finance the construction of an airplane designed to attempt the crossing.\tDuring 1940 he began speaking out against voluntary American involvement in World War II, soon becoming the non-interventionists leading spokesman.\tDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Lindbergh travelled widely, developing an interest in the cultures of peoples in Africa and the Philippines, and in conservation, working with such organizations as the World Wildlife Fund, particularly in Alaska.\tHauptmann was convicted of the crime, and was executed in April 1936.\tHe became a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and served on a number of other aeronautical boards and committees.\tHe learned about the rocket research of Robert H. Goddard, and persuaded the Guggenheim family to support Goddard's experiments.\tHowever, he caused some outrage in the U.S. when in 1938 he accepted a German medal of honor from Goering.\tIn 1919, a New York City hotel owner named Raymond Orteig had offered $25,000 to the first aviator to fly non-stop from New York to Paris, and during the 1920s several pilots were killed or injured while competing for the Orteig prize.\tIn 1924 Lindbergh enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Service and in March 1925, graduated from the Advanced Flying School.\tIn 1926 he was hired by the Robertson Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis to fly mail between St. Louis and Chicago.\tIn 1927, Lindbergh flew throughout the United States to encourage air- mindedness on behalf of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics.\tIn 1935, after the  Hauptmann trial, Lindbergh, his wife and their 3-year- old son, Jon, moved first to England and then to France in search of privacy and safety.\tIn 1954, President Eisenhower restored Lindbergh's commission in the Air Force Reserve, and promoted him to the rank of brigadier general.\tIn March 1932 the Lindberghs' 20-month-old son, Charles Augustus, Jr., was kidnapped from the family home in New Jersey.\tIn this role, Lindbergh frequently criticized President Franklin D. Roosevelt's foreign policies, and also accused British, Jewish, and pro- Roosevelt groups of leading America into war.\tLindbergh and Anne Morrow were married in 1929 and became instantly one of the most high- profile couples in the United States.\tLindbergh chose the Ryan Aeronautical Company of San Diego to manufacture a special single-engine monoplane, powered by a Wright radial engine, which he helped design, and which he named the 'Spirit of St. Louis'.\tLindbergh taught his new wife to fly, and during the early 1930s they made many flying expeditions together (Anne Morrow Lindbergh serving as co-pilot and navigator) throughout the world, promoting the development of commercial aviation by exploring and charting new air routes and acting as technical adviser for two airlines, Transcontinental Air Transport and PanAm.\tOn 10-11 May 1927, Lindbergh tested the plane by flying from San Diego to New York City, with an overnight stop in St. Louis, a flight which took 20 hours 21 minutes, a transcontinental record.\tOnce the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and the U.S. had declared war on the Axis powers, however, Lindbergh pledged his support to the war effort.\tOver the following weeks, hundreds of thousands of people crowded to see him at receptions in London, Washington, New York and St. Louis, and won the Congressional Medal of Honor.\tSikorsky's first Clipper.\tThe following year Lindbergh bought his first plane, a World War I Curtiss Jenny, with which he \"\"barnstormed\"\" through the South and West.\tThe most acclaimed aviator in American history.\tWhile in Mexico, he met Anne Spencer Morrow,  the daughter of Dwight W.
