letters, punctuation marks, and blank pieces of type for the spaces - were needed for a few pages of a book.\tIt has been estimated that two pages of Gutenberg's Bible would have needed about six thousand pieces of type, all of which had to be exactly the same depth to produce uniform print.\tIt is  probable, but not certain, that Gutenberg learned precision metalwork at the Mainz mint, where as a youth he would have seen the complex processes involved in producing coinage, which involved the careful and accurate casting and stamping of gold, an understanding of metals and temperature, and a knowledge of the use of casting chambers, dies and presses.\tJohann Gutenberg was born c. 1397 at Mainz (on the River Rhine in Germany) famous for jewel accessories,  metal-polishing, gold and silverwork.\tMeanwhile, Fust had gained control of the type for the Bible and for Gutenberg's other masterpiece, an edition of the Psalter, and most of Gutenberg's printing equipment.\tMeanwhile, Gutenberg had at last perfected his method of casting type sufficiently to set about printing his chosen text, the Bible, probably starting work on this enormous project in 1452.\tMeanwhile, it appears that during the late 1450s Gutenberg was able to establish a print-shop but all that is known for certain of Gutenberg's last years is that in January 1465 he received a pension from the archbishop of Mainz, as a distinguished citizen of Mainz, and was given an annual measure of grain, wine, and clothing and exempted from certain taxes.\tPreviously books had been printed by carving out each page individually on a wood block, which meant that only the very wealthy were able to afford them, and although experiments with moveable type were made in wood during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the wood-carvers had not been able to produce small type precise enough for book work.\tThe Psalter was reprinted again and again, using the same type, until 1516, and Fust and Schoeffer were the first printers to adopt the practice, which later became standard, of storing set type for future editions to save the expense of resetting.\tThe agreement with Riffe and Heilmann came to an end in 1443, by which time it is assumed (on the basis of the existence of a scrap of paper with eleven printed lines on each side, dated to 1442, which is the oldest example of European printing from moveable type) that Gutenberg had had begun printing.\tThe art of printing using moveable type is thought to have been originally invented during the 11th century in China,  but it was unknown in Europe.\tThe evidence for this is a five-year agreement he made in 1438 with three Strasbourg men - Hans Riffe, Andres Heilmann and Andres Dritzehen - which indicates that by this date Gutenberg had invented a new technological process (in all probability his prototype printing press) and agreed to teach it to his three partners in return for a fee and large loans.\tThe invention consisted of:-   a mold with punch-stamped matrices (metal prisms used to mold the face of the type) with which type could be cast precisely and in large quantities, a type-metal alloy, a specially-designed press (based on those used in wine making, papermaking, and bookbinding), and an oil-based printing ink.\tThe partnership agreement ended in 1443, and by 1450 Gutenberg was back in Mainz borrowing money from goldsmith and financier Johann Fust to set up a new press, with the printing tools and equipment acting as security.\tThis suggests that by 1438 Gutenberg and Dritzehen had in all probability already invented a printing process using moveable type (separate pieces of wood or metal for each letter of the alphabet).\tThis work, now known as the Gutenberg Bible, is regarded as the first major book to come from a printing press.\tTwo years later Fust invested more and became Gutenberg's partner.\tUsing paper he had made from cloth rags and vellum sheets, Gutenberg set about printing his Bible, which may have begun as early as 1450 (but more probably in 1452).\tWithin a few months one of the partners, Andreas Dritzehen, had died, and in 1439  his brother went to court demanding a partnership in the concern.", "answer_type": "base.kwebbase.kwsentence", "agg": false, "raw_paths": [["Main", 0, "m.04061", ["base.kwebbase.kwtopic.has_sentences"]]]}
