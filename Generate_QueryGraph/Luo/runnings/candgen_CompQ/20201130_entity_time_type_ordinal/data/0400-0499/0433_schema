burlesque of dramatist/poet laureate Cibber, and bemoaning the triumph of chaos and dullness.)\t(The other five members were Swift, Thomas Parnell, Gay, Arbuthnot, and Robert Harley [Lord Oxford])\tAdmired Gainsborough.\tAfter the huge success of the \"\"Iliad\"\", Pope began to translate Homer's \"\"Odyssey\"\", and asked Elijah Fenton and William Broome to help him.\tAlso in 1712, Pope began to write his best-known satire, the mock-heroic \"\"Rape of the Lock\"\", which was published to great acclaim two years later.\tAt 16, Pope became the protege of former Oxford teacher, Sir William Trumbull, and soon met the members of the late John Dryden's circle, notably William Wycherley, William Walsh, and Henry Cromwell, who acted as his literary mentors.\tBy 1705, Pope's four \"\"Pastorals\"\" were in draft and circulating among the best literary judges of the day, before being published in 1709.\tDedicated his \"\"Iliad\"\" translation to Congreve.\tDuring his \"\"Iliad\"\" work, he also published a volume of his collected \"\"Works\"\", adding \"\"Eloise to Abelard\"\", \"\"Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\"\", and two poems in the style of Ovid.\tFriend of Frederick Prince of Wales, and  Cheselden.\tHe became one of six members of the Scriblerus Club, which met over dinner once a week to talk about literature and write satirically about those in the news.\tHe feuded with Lord Hervey (whom he addressed as \"\"Lord Fanny\"\") and his ex- love Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (he called her \"\"Lewd Lesbia\"\").\tImpressed by the work, Steele and Joseph Addison invited Pope to contribute to their  journal \"\"The Spectator\"\", and in 1712, published the most original of Pope's pastorals, \"\"The Messiah\"\".\tIn 1711, at 23, he scored his first great success with \"\"An Essay on Criticism\"\", a poem summarizing all past wisdom on poetry and criticism.\tIn 1714, Pope began translating Homer's \"\"Iliad\"\" into English, using rhyming couplets.\tIn 1723, Pope turned to editing and by 1725 had produced a six-volume edition of Shakespeare.\tIn 1733, Pope published his \"\"First Satire Of the Second Book Of Horace, Imitated,\"\"  a defense of satire and an attack on corrupt politics.\tIn an impish reissue of the poem in 1729, Pope included an elaborate array of mock prefaces, notes, appendixes, indexes, and errata, whimsically giving the impression that \"\"The Dunciad\"\" had fallen victim to the idiocy of the times and had been re- edited by a moron.\tIn his mid-40s, Pope began to suffer ill health and he divided his time between health resorts and his villa on the Thames at Twickenham.\tIt abounds with much-quoted epigrams: \"\"A little learning is a dangerous thing,\"\" \"\"To err is human, to forgive, divine,\"\" and \"\"For fools rush in where angels fear to tread\"\".\tIt earned Pope so much money that he proudly became the first known English author to live off his writings without the assistance of a patron.\tKnew Hogarth. met Voltaire  and Algarotti.\tKnew Kent and Bridgeman.\tLike many of his earlier works, the work provoked bitter and personal attacks against him, many of which he answered in his autobiographical poem, \"\"Epistle to Arbuthnot\"\", (1735).\tMost of his friends shared his passion for gardening, and he celebrated this affinity in \"\"Epistle to the Right Honourable Richard Earl of Burlington\"\" in 1731.\tPope found himself increasingly drawn to writers who supported the Tory government, and his poem, \"\"Windsor-Forest\"\"(1713), which celebrated the Treaty of Utrecht, was taken by many, despite Pope's denials, to be a commitment to the Tories.\tPope revised their contributions, then passed them off as his own, a questionable act that caused him some embarrassment when it became known, but the venture was enormously successful.\tThe man of the title, Lord Burlington (an architect reformer and husband of caricaturist and arts patron Lady Dorothy Savile) was delighted with the poem, which Pope published with three other poems in the \"\"Moral Essays\"\".\tThe monumental task took six years, but he came out in 1715 with the first four books, and published four books a year until the work was finished.\tThe series concluded with two dialogues in verse, republished as the \"\"Epilogue to the Satires\"\" (1738).\tThe success of his \"\"Horace\"\" imitation led to 13 more paraphrases of Horace themes between 1734 and 1738.\tTheobald's attack spurred Pope to write his first major satire, the three- volume \"\"The Dunciad\"\" (1728), another mock-heroic epic, which focused on the pretentiousness and dullness of contemporary writers.\tThinly disguised, Theobald appeared as the \"\"Prince of Dulness\"\", and other Pope rivals were portrayed equally as brutally.\tThrough these imitations Pope commented on the contemporary social and political scene.\tTo escape possible attacks, In 1734 Pope published perhaps his most ambitious work, the philosophical \"\"An Essay on Man\"\",  anonymously.\tTwo major projects of his last years were \"\"Letters\"\" and a reworking of \"\"The Dunciad\"\", published in 1742.\tWas influenced by Boileau.",
